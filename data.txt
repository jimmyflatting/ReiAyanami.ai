Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

2015 A.D.

At 12:30 p.m. today, a special state
of emergency has been declared

for the Toukai region
and the surrounding mid-Kanto area.

All residents, proceed to your designated
evacuation shelter immediately.

I repeat, at 12:30 p.m. today,

a special state of emergency
has been declared

for the Toukai region
and the surrounding mid-Kanto area.

Proceed to your designated...

How could I lose track of him
at a time like this?

I don't believe this...

All phone lines

are currently disabled due to
the special state of emergency.

I can't reach her?

I shouldn't have come.

I'll never make it.

That's that, then.
Might as well head to a shelter.

Unidentified object is continuing
its approach to this facility.

We have visual on target.
Sending to main screen.

It's been 15 years.

Yes, there's no doubt about it.

It's an Angel.

All missiles, direct hit!

Sorry! Been waiting long?

Target unfazed. It is continuing
to advance towards Tokyo-3.

Local air units are unable
to slow its advance!

This is total war. Launch all units
from Atsugi and Iruma as well.

Commit everything we have!
Crush the target at all costs!

This makes no sense!
Those were direct hits!

Our armored battalion has been wiped out.

Guided munitions, bombs,
and artillery are having no effect.

D*** it! This kind of firepower
isn't getting us anywhere!

An A.T. Field?

Yes. Standard weapons
will be useless against the Angels.

Yes, sir. We'll deploy it
according to plan.

They wouldn't...
They're gonna use an N2 land mine?!

Get down!

We did it!

Sorry, but your services
weren't required this time.

Shock wave incoming.

Are you okay?

Yes, but I got some sand in my mouth.

Glad to hear it. Okay...

Here we go!

One, two!

Thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

No, I should be thanking you,
Ms. Katsuragi.

Call me Misato, okay?

It's nice to meet you, Shinji Ikari.

Thank you.

Target's current status?

Target status unknown, EMI too strong.

You saw that explosion!
It must have been obliterated!

Sensors coming back online.

Energy readings at ground zero!

What?!

Visual feed back online.

That was our ace in the hole...

This can't be happening.

***-d***** monster!

Yes, not to worry.
His protection has top priority.

So have the car shuttle train standing by.
The direct service line.

Right. Well, I am the one
who said I would go meet him.

So I'm keeping my word. Bye.

Man, what a day!

I just had this car restored,
and it's trashed already!

Repair fees, on top of another
33 months of car payments...

Plus, my best outfit is ruined!

-Um, Ms. Misato?
-I got all decked out for today...

-Excuse me, Ms. Misato?
-Yes, what?

Was it okay for you to do that?

Oh, don't worry about it!

This is an emergency!
I had to get the car moving, right?

And I might not look it,
but I'm an international civil servant.

So it's perfectly legit!

That's not very convincing.

Oh, lighten up.

For a kid with such a cute face,
you sure are uptight.

Am I?

Oops! Are you mad?

I'm so sorry! You're a boy, after all.

Actually, you seem a bit childish
for someone your age, Ms. Misato.

As we predicted, it's regenerating?

If it couldn't, it would be worthless
as a standalone weapon.

Very impressive. It's even capable
of enhancing its abilities?

And it's getting smarter.

It's only a matter of time
before it resumes its advance.

Gates closing. Please stay clear.

Special Agency Nerv?

Right. It's a secret organization
directly attached to the UN.

My father works here, doesn't he?

Yup. Do you know
what your father does here?

A teacher told me that he has
the important job of protecting humanity.

As of this moment, you have been
given command over this operation.

-Let's see what you can do.
-Understood, sir.

Ikari, I'll admit that our ordnance
is ineffective against the target.

Can you defeat it, though?

This is what Nerv is for.

Don't let us down.

Target status has not changed.

Current intercept capacity is at 7.5%.

The UN Forces have given up, then?
What do you intend to do?

We'll activate Unit 01.

Unit 01? But there's no pilot.

Not a problem.
The spare pilot will arrive shortly.

Will we be going to see my father?

Yes, I think so.

Father...

Oh, right! Did your father
send you any ID forms?

Yes.

Here.

Thanks.

COME HERE!
-GENDOH IKARI

Read through this, okay?

"Welcome to Nerv"?

My father's work...

Am I supposed to do something at Nerv?

There has to be. Otherwise,
Father wouldn't have written to me.

Oh, I see. Dealing with your father
isn't your strong suit, huh?

Just like me, huh?

Wow!

-A bona fide Geo-front!
-That's right.

Over there is our secret base,
Nerv headquarters.

The key to rebuilding the world,
and the last bastion of humanity.

This is so strange...

I could swear it was this way.

Closed Central Dogma passages
will remain...

Wearing skirts in this place
is a bad idea.

I wonder where Ritsuko went?

I'm sorry, I don't have my bearings yet.

We passed through here already.

Well, not to worry!
Nerv has systems for this very situation.

Paging Project E. Dir., Dr. Ritsuko Akagi
of Technology Division Section 1.

Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

Please contact Capt. Misato Katsuragi
of Operations Division Section 1.

I don't believe it.
She's lost again, isn't she?

Oops! Hi, Ritsuko!

Where have you been, Capt. Katsuragi?
We're short on both manpower and time.

Sorry!

This is the boy?

Yep. He's the Third Children
reported by the Marduk Institute.

Nice to meet you.

Uh, yes, ma'am.

That's another way
that he takes after his father.

A total lack of charm.

Take care of things here.

They haven't seen each other
in three years.

Deputy Commander,
the target has begun moving again.

Very well. All personnel
to condition one battle stations.

I repeat, condition one battle stations!
Prepare for ground intercept.

-Hear that?
-This sounds bad.

So, how is Unit 01?

It's being cooled down
in its Type B Configuration.

It that thing really going to work?
It's hasn't worked once, right?

The odds of a successful activation
are 0.000000001%.

Calling it the 0-9 System
was certainly appropriate.

Doesn't that mean it won't work?

Don't be rude. It's not 0%.

Sure, numerically.

Ah, well. We don't exactly have
the luxury of accepting failure.

Um, I can't see a thing!

A face? A giant robot!

You won't find this
in the orientation book.

This is the ultimate multipurpose decisive
combat weapons system created by man.

The Artificial Human Evangelion.

Unit 01 of the series.

Built in complete secrecy,

this is mankind's very last trump card.

-This is part of my father's work?
-Correct.

It's been a while.

Father...

Launch the Eva.

Launch the Eva?
But Unit 00 is still grounded!

Wait, you want to use Unit 01?!

There's no other choice.

Wait just a second!
Rei's in no condition for that!

It's got no pilot!

He just arrived.

Are you serious?

-Shinji Ikari.
-Yes?

You're going to pilot it.

But it took even Rei Ayanami seven months
to synchronize with her Eva!

He literally just got here!
He couldn't possibly do it!

All I ask is that he sit in the cockpit.
Nothing more.

But...

Repelling that Angel
is our number one priority right now.

For that, we need anyone capable of
synchronizing with an Eva to try,

however remote the chances.

I shouldn't need to tell you this,
Capt. Katsuragi.

You're right.

Father... Why did you send for me?

For the reason you're thinking.

So you want me to get inside this
and fight that thing out there?

Correct.

I don't want to do that!
Why send for me after all this time?!

I thought you left me
because you didn't need me!

I do now, so I sent for you.

But why me?

Because it's impossible for anyone else.

It is for me, too. I've never seen
or heard of this thing before.

I can't possibly do it!

Learn how.

That's... That's impossible!

There's no way I can pilot this!

If you're going to pilot it, do it.
Otherwise, get out!

That b****** must have figured out
where we are.

Shinji, we don't have much time.

Get in.

No way. I just got here! This is crazy!

Tell me, Shinji. Why did you come?

Don't run away! Not from your father,
and especially not from yourself.

I know! But there's no way I can do this!

Fuyutsuki.

Wake up Rei.

Is she viable?

She isn't dead.

Understood.

-Rei?
-Yes?

The backup isn't working out.
I need you again.

Yes, sir.

Rewrite Unit 01's core system
for Rei! Reactivate!

Roger. Suspending current tasks
and initiating reactivation.

I knew it... No one wants me.

Look out!

-The Eva moved!
-What the heck?

Its right arm broke free
of its restraints!

What?! That can't be!
It doesn't have an entry plug inserted!

It's incapable of moving!

It reacted without any
interface connection?

Or was it trying... to protect him?

This will work.

Don't run away.

I'll do it. I'll be the pilot!

-Cooling cycle complete!
-Right arm reattachment complete.

All gear inside cage
is in docked position.

Shutdown signal plug extraction complete.

Roger. Inserting entry plug.

-Plug locked in position.
-Initiating level one connection.

Flooding entry plug.

Huh? What is this stuff?

Don't worry,
once your lungs are filled with LCL,

it will feed oxygen
directly into your bloodstream.

You'll get used to it in no time.

This is so gross.

Deal with it! You're a big boy!

-Main power connection complete!
-Feeding power to all circuits!

Roger!

Initiating level two contact.

A10 nerve connection, status green.

Cognitive configuration
base rules set to Japanese.

Initial contact shows all green.

Opening bilateral circuit.

Synchronization rate at 41.3%.

-Amazing...
-Harmonics are all at normal levels.

-No signs of a runaway.
-We're good to go!

Prepare for launch!

Prepare for launch!

Release lockdown bolt no. 01!

Release confirmed!

Initiating umbilical bridge retraction!

Release lockdown bolt no. 02!

Retracting primary restraining frame.

Removing secondary
restraining frame, as well.

Disengaging safety systems one through 15.

Roger. Transport Eva-01 to launch bay.

Launch path clear! All stations green!

Launch preparations complete!

Roger that!

-Do we have a go, sir?
-Absolutely.

Unless we defeat the Angels,
humanity has no future.

Ikari, you're really sure about this?

Launch!

Shinji... don't die.

TO BE CONTINUED

NEXT EPISODE

The Eva defeats the Angel,
but that was just the beginning.

Shinji runs away from his father.

Misato's arrogance makes her
decide to try to save him.

Are you ready, Shinji ?

Ah, yes.

Remove the final
safety lock !

Evangelion Unit 01, lift off !

Shinji, think only
of walking now.

Walking...

It's walking !

Walking...

Shinji, come on !
Hurry, stand up quickly !

Shinji, calm down !
It's not your arm !

How's Eva's
defense system ?

The signal isn't working.

The Field hasn't developed !

It's not working ?!

Left arm damaged !

Circuits have snapped !

Shinji, escape !

The front area of
the head is cracked !

The armor won't
stand any more.

Head damaged.
Damage unidentified.

The nerves for control are
snapping one after another.

No response from the pilot !

Shinji !

An unknown ceiling...

EPISODE: 2
UNKNOWN
CEILINGS

The second coming of Angels...
It's too abrupt.

It's the same as 15 years ago.
A disaster always comes without notice.

In a way, it may be fortunate for us, because our prior investment didn't come to nothing...

Things have never turned out yet.
If it's useless, it's a waste.

That's right.

About cleaning up the aftermath of the Angels, which are now public knowledge...

...and information control... Have Nerv handle both of them appropriately and smoothly.

Those matters are already
taken care of. Relax.

The Government announcement regarding yesterday's special state emergency, states...

In this incident...

The UN forces in Japan...

The announcement was ``Scenario B-22.''
The facts were hushed up again.

The public relations department seems to be happy because they've got things to do at last.

They seem very optimistic.

Well...The truth is
that everyone is afraid.

Of course !

That's about it.

But, Ikari, can't you use
Nerv and Eva in better ways ?

The repair costs for Unit 00
and Unit 01 could ruin a country.

I heard that you gave
that toy to your son.

Humans, time and money...

How much must be spent by you and your son to satisfy you ?

Moreover, you have another
job to do, don't you ?

The Human Complement Project,
that must have top priority.

That's right. That project is our only hope under such hopeless circumstances.

Anyway, although the Angels came again, the project can't be allowed to fall behind schedule.

As for the budgets,
we'll consider them.

Well, the committee
will take over now.

Ikari, thanks.

Ikari, you can't turn back.

I know.
Humanity has no time.

I always think an air conditioner's the greatest treasure of humanity ! A scientific success !

Shinji has recovered consciousness.

How is he ?

No external wounds.
His memory is somewhat confused.

It can't be...Is it
mental contamination...?

I heard it's nothing
to worry about.

Oh, really.

That's right, because
it was so sudden...

It's no wonder. A severe burden was imposed on his cranial nerves.

I think you mean M-I-N-D.

If Eva and this city are successful, we'll be able to win.

Will you defeat the Angels ?
You're as optimistic as ever.

Wishful thinking is a
necessity of human life.

Right. Your optimistic
character is encouraging.

'Bye.

Is it alright that
they live separately ?

For Ikari and his son,
it's natural to be without each other.

If anything, it's unusual
to live together...is it so...

Alone ?

Yes, his room is located in
Block 6, over there. Any problems ?

No.

Are you satisfied
with it, Shinji ?

I prefer being alone.
All places are the same.

What ?!

As I said, I've decided to take charge of Shinji. I've got my superior's approval.

Don't worry. I won't have
an affair with a child.

That goes without saying !
What the hell are you thinking ?!

As always, she can't
understand a joke.

Well, tonight we're going to do it flamboyantly, aren't we ?

What do you mean ?

It's a welcome party for
a new lodger, of course !

Are you also
going to move ?

I'd never seriously thought that this city would really become a battlefield.

My husband told me that our children and I should move for safety at least.

Move for safety... Even if this is a fortress city, we can't rely on anything at all.

Yesterday's incident...The mere recollection of it makes me shudder.

Well, we're stopping
some place on the way.

Where are we going ?

It..is...a...good...place.

For some reason...this is a
lonesome city, isn't it ?

It's time.

Awesome !
The buildings are growing !

This is the fortress city for intercepting the Angels. ``Tokyo-3''... Our hometown...

...and the city
which you protected.

NEON GENESIS

I think your
things have arrived.

Actually, I also just
recently moved to this town.

Come on in.

Um...May I come in ?

Shinji, this is your house.

I...I'm back.

Welcome home.

Well, the place is a little untidy...
Hope you don't mind.

A...a little, she said...?

Oh, sorry. Could you put the food in the refrigerator ?

Ah, sure.

Ice...

Relishes...

And beer...

What kind of life
does she lead ?

Well, the refrigerator
over there...

Ah, it's OK.
Perhaps...sleeping now.

Sleeping...?

Thanks for food !

Thanks for food.

Oh my, what a life !
I just live for such times !

Ah, don't you like them ? They're rather tasty, even though they're instant.

No, but...I'm not
used to such a meal.

No, don't be fussy !

Ah...no...ah,
I didn't mean that.

Don't you think it's nice...

...having a meal with others ?

Sure.

Well. Next, here goes !

Jan-ken-pon !

Pon !

Pon !

Pon !

Pon !

You were unlucky, Shinji.

As for the everyday duties which we've fairly decided, everything is A-OK.

Yeah.

Well, because this is now your house, you can really feel at home here.

Ah...yeah.

Hey ! ``Yes, yeah, sure, okay''...
How gloomy !

You're a boy, aren't you ?
Pull yourself together !

Okay.

It's okay. Take a bath and wash all the unpleasant things away.

Taking a bath
is life washing.

Mi...Mi...Mi...Misato !

What's wrong ?

Th...the...ther
...there's a...

Oh, him ? A new kind of
hot spring penguin.

It's...

His name's Penpen.
He's another lodger.

By the way, you'd
better cover the front.

Am I being a little too playful ?
I may be the one who's transparent.

Katsuragi Misato...

She isn't a bad person.

Taking a bath is
life washing.

But, in the bath, more unpleasant things come to my mind than others.

Father and Ayanami Rei...?

How was Rei ?

You went to the hospital this afternoon, didn't you ?

She'll be able
to move in 20 days.

Meanwhile, I'll get the committee's agreement for Unit 00's restart.

What pain, they have...

There's no one else who can use Eva.
As long as they live, I let them do it.

No matter what
the children think...?

Yes. He had such a bitter experience.
I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

Maintenance of ``him'' is
your job, isn't it ?

I'm afraid I don't know how to get along with him.

Grumbling already ? You declared theatrically that you'd take charge of him, didn't you ?

Shut up !

I also regarded him as
my tool at that time.

I'm the same as Ritsuko.
Although we defeated the Angel...

...I don't feel happy.

This is an
unknown ceiling, too.

It's only natural... I don't know any place in this city.

This is your home.

Why am I here ?

Head damaged !
Damage unidentified !

Trouble keeping
it activated !

Status report !

Synchrograph has reversed.
Pulses are flowing backward !

Cut the circuits !
Stop them !

We can't. The signal is refused.
It can't be received !

What about Shinji ?

No response from the monitoring system. We can't tell if he's alive !

Unit 01 is totally silent.

Misato !

So much for this time...
Abort the operation !

Pilot's protection is top priority !
Eject the plug by force !

Impossible.
It's totally out of control.

What ?!

Eva has restarted !

No way !
It can't move !

It can't be...

Out of control.

He's won.

The AT-field...

It's no use. As long it
has the AT-field...

...Eva can't touch it.

Left arm restored.

Unbelievable...

Unit 01 is also expanding an AT-field.
It's neutralizing the phase space.

No, it's eroding it.

That AT-field
was so easily...

Self destruct ?!

The Eva...

That's Eva's...

...true potential...

The circuits
have been restored.

The system is operational.
The graph is in the normal position.

Pilot's survival confirmed.

Body Recovery Team, move it !

The pilot's recovery
is top priority.

Shinji, may I open the door ?

You did a praiseworthy thing today.
You should be proud of yourself.

Good night, Shinji.

Hang in there.

Good morning, Shinji. How's it going?

No problems.

l'm getting used to it.

That's good.

Have you memorized the positions of
all the Eva emergence points,

emergency power junctions, armament
equipment buildings and recovery zones?

l guess so.

Well, let's review it now.

Normally the Eva runs off electricity
provided by an umbilical cable.

ln emergencies, it can switch
to a built-in battery,

with an active life of one
minute at full power,

and no more than five minutes in
the minimal activity gain mode.

This is due to our current limits
in battery capacity technology.

Do you understand?

Yes.

Now let's continue from where we left
off yesterday. lnitiate lnduction Mode.

Position the target in the center,

then switch "on".

Take it easy. Position the target
in the center.

Then pull the switch.

Next!

You know, l wonder why Shinji agreed to
be a pilot after what happened.

lt would seem that he simply does
what he's told to do.

l suppose that's just his way
of getting through life.

Target in the center, pull the switch.

Target in the center, pull the switch.

Target in the center, pull the switch.

Target in the center, pull the switch.

Target in the center...

And now, from Tokyo we go to
Natsuko Shinohara in Matsuzaki.

Good morning, this is Shinohara.
Guess what?

Today l'm in Matsuzaki in West lzu
for a little scuba diving!

Miss Misato, it's morning already.

Miss Misato, it's morning already.

l just got back from night duty.

l just got back from night duty.

l just got back from night duty.
Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.

l don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.

l don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.

l see. l'll go.

Hey, isn't today Thursday?

Hey, isn't today Thursday?

Take the burnable trash to
the garbage, please.

Yes, Ma'am.

Yes, Ma'am.

So, how's school?

Fine.

Oh, okay. Take care.

Oh, okay. Take care.

l'll see you later.

Yes? Hello?

Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

How's it going? Are you getting
along with him?

Him?

Oh, Shinji.

Well, he transferred into school two
weeks ago and he hasn't changed.

No one ever calls him.

Calls him?

Well, since l figured he'd be needing
one, l gave him a cellular phone.

l don't think he's ever used it though,
or received any calls.

l'm not sure, but l don't think
he has any friends.

Well, l would guess that Shinji's not
the sort who makes friends easily.

Do you know the fable of the
"Hedgehog's Dilemma"?

Hedgehog? You mean those animals
with the spiny hair?

Even though a hedgehog may wish to
become close with another hedgehog,

the closer they get, the more they
injure each other with their spines.

lt's the same with some humans.

The reason he seems so withdrawn is
because he's afraid of being hurt.

Well, he's going to have to learn
someday that part of growing up

means finding a way to interact with
others while distancing pain.

What's up, class rep?

Did you give him the printout
l gave you yesterday?

What? Well...

Well, there wasn't anybody
home at Toji's place.

Mr. Aida, aren't you
Mr. Suzuhara's friend?

Aren't you worried about him?

Do you suppose he's injured?

What? ln that robot incident?!

The television report said
that nobody was injured!

No way, you saw where the explosion
was on Mount Takanosu, didn't you?

There were fighters scrambled
from lruma and Komatsu,

and there were also troops
from Misawa and Kyushu.

l'll bet at least ten or twenty
people were injured,

and there had to be some killed, too.

Toji!

Suzuhara!

Wow, has the class population
dropped or what?

They've all been evacuated or
transferred to other schools.

After all, no one wants to stay after
that last battle inside the city.

Yeah, you're probably the only one

who's actually enjoying the
chance to see a real war.

Yeah, l am.

And speaking of which,
where have you been, Toji?

Why were you absent so long?
Did you get involved in the war?

My little sister did.

She was crushed under a pile of debris.

She survived but she's been in
the hospital ever since.

Both my dad and grand-dad
are working at the lab,

and there's no way they
can leave their posts.

So, if l'm not with her,
she's all alone.

That robot's pilot was really dumb!
lt makes me so angry!

How could he wreck our own city?
What was he doing?

Oh, about the pilot, have you heard the
rumor about the new transfer student?

What transfer student?

Him, over there.

He transferred here while
you were absent.

He came right after the incident.
Don't you think that's odd?

All rise!

And so, humankind was about to
face its greatest trial.

ln the last year of the 20th century,

the massive meteor from space slammed
into the continent of Antarctica.

The continent's ice cap was melted
almost instantaneously.

The water level of the oceans
increased dramatically,

the Earth was thrown off its axis,

and new, devastatingly abnormal,
weather patterns were spawned.

The lives of all living things on
the planet were threatened.

Several thousand species and half
of the world's human population

were lost in the immediate aftermath.

That was the so-called "Second lmpact".

The survivors still had to
live through the hell

of worldwide economic collapse,
ethnic conflicts, and civil wars.

However, it has been fifteen
years since then.

ln only fifteen years,
we have restored ourselves.

This is certainly proof of the human
race's resilience, but even more so,

it is the fruit of the blood,
sweat and tears

your fathers and mothers have
dedicated to this cause.

What?!

Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!

Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!

Really, the new student was?

Really, the new student was?

Hey, you guys!

We're still in class, you know!

Sit down now!

Aw, you're always so bossy!

Hey, come on! Forget her!

Now cut that out!

Cool, it's awesome!

Well, umm...

Hey, how were you chosen?

Were there any tests?

Weren't you scared?

What's the cockpit look like?

Well, l'm not supposed to
talk about secret stuff.

Oh, come on! Don't be mean!

Hey, what's the name of the robot?

l don't know much, but everyone
calls it Eva or Unit 01:

Eva?

And what's its ultimate attack mode?

Some kind of vibrating knife.

An ultra-sonic wave.

That's amazing! We're so proud of you!

Yeah, right! Cool! Yeah.

And thus...

Oh...

That's all for today.

lkari, where do you live?

ln the older part of the city?

Hey, you guys, why don't you at least
show some manners at the end?

Sorry, newcomer, but l've
got to beat you up!

l've got to work off my anger.

Sorry, his sister was injured
because of the incident.

That's his excuse, anyway.

l didn't pilot it by choice.

We've got an emergency call.

l'll go.

A special state of emergency
has been declared

for the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district.

All residents must evacuate to their
designated shelters immediately.

Repeating: a state of emergency
has been declared...

The target has been sighted
by our cameras.

lt's already penetrated into
our territorial waters.

Assume battle stations, level one.

Roger, prepare for
anti-aircraft interception.

Tokyo 3 transforming to

lnitiate accommodation of
the central block.

Accommodation of central block

and the first through seventh
districts has been completed.

Notification of the government and
other related ministries, completed.

Present effective rate of
anti-aircraft interception: 48%.

What's the status of
noncombatants and civilians?

We've already received reports that the
evacuation has been completed.

Attention elementary school and
junior high school students.

Please form groups with your
individual classes.

Area residents, please group according
to your block numbers.

Not again!

Just text messages again?

lt's news censorship. They won't
show any of it to us civilians.

Even though it's an incredible event.

The fourth Angel would show up while
Commander lkari is away.

lt's a lot sooner than we expected.

The last time they gave us
a fifteen year break.

This time it's been only three weeks.

They never care about our
situation, do they?

They're the type we women hate the most.

lt's a waste of the taxpayers' money.

The committee is demanding that we
dispatch an Evangelion again.

Oh, they get on my nerves.

lf they hadn't asked for it,
l'd have mobilized it anyway.

Entry procedure initiated.

LCL oxygenated.

Releasing airlock.

Why am l piloting this thing again,
even though my father's not here?

Even though l got beat up?

Hey, l need to talk to you,
privately, you know?

What for?

Just give me a second, okay?

Well, okay.

Class rep!

What?

We've both have to go to the bathroom!

You were supposed to use the
bathroom before you came here.

So, what's this about?

l've got to see it,
at least once in my life.

You mean the battle up there?

Nobody knows when the enemy
will come the next time.

Kensuke, are you serious?

lf we let this opportunity escape us,
we may lose it forever!

Please, help me unlock the gate.

But you could get killed
if you go out there.

lf we stay here in the shelter, who's
to say that the risk isn't the same?

lf l could be killed anyway,
l'd rather see it first.

You idiot. What do you
think NERV's for?

And what is NERV's most
important weapon?

lt's the robot the new kid pilots.

He protected us the other day,

but you hit him pretty hard. Twice!

lf he refuses to fight,
we're all going to die.

Doesn't that make it your
obligation to watch him fight?

Okay, you're not leaving
me any options!

You'll do anything to get what
you want, won't you?

Shinji, are you ready?

Yes.

First, neutralize the enemy's
AT field, then fire a volley.

Do it just like we practiced.
Can you handle that?

Yes.

Launch!

Cool! All my efforts really paid off!
l've been waiting for this all my life!

Oh! This is it!

There it is!

The AT field has been deployed.

Do it just as planned, okay, Shinji?

Right.

You idiot! You hid the enemy
with your own smoke!

l can't believe it!
He's already losing!

Not a problem.

l'm sending you a spare rifle.

Take it!

Shinji? Hey, Shinji?

Jeez...

Being beaten up must have
really messed him up.

Shut up!

The umbilical cable's been snapped off!

Eva has switched to its internal
battery power source.

4 minutes, 53 seconds of
activation remaining.

lt's coming this way!

Shinji, are you all right? Shinji!

Damage report?

No problems detected. He can make it.

Shinji's classmates?

What are they doing there?

Why won't he fight?

Because we're here?

He can't move because of us!

Activation time remaining:
3 minutes 28 seconds.

Shinji, let them into the cockpit!

Once you've got them,
make a temporary retreat.

We'll start again later!

How can you think unauthorized civilians
can be allowed into the entry plug?!

l'm authorizing it.

You're exceeding your authority,
Captain Katsuragi!

Unit 01's remaining activation
time: 3 minutes.

Hold Eva on your current commands and
eject the entry plug. Hurry up!

You two! Get in! Now!

What the... lt's water?

My camera! My camera!

Abnormal conditions occurring
in the nervous system.

Of course. lt's because you've allowed
two foreign bodies into the matrix!

They're being detected as noise
in the nerve impulse systems!

Retreat! Now!

Utilize recovery route 34, retreat
to the east side of the mountain.

Hey, new kid, she said, "Retreat!"

l mustn't run away. l mustn't run away.

l mustn't run away!

Progressive Knife engaged!

Obey my orders, Shinji!
You've got to retreat!

Shinji!

Eva Unit 01, activation ceased.

The target is completely silent.

lt's been three days.

You mean, since we were chewed out?

No, since he stopped
coming to school.

Who's "he"?

The new kid, of course.

l wonder what he's been
doing since then?

Are you worried about him?

No, not exactly worried.

Toji, for someone who's so tactless,
you're pretty stubborn.

lf you had apologized to him back then,

you wouldn't have had to agonize
over it for three days.

Here, this is the new
kid's phone number.

lf you're so worried, why
don't you call him?

As the dreary rain pours down,

Shinji, overwhelmed and unable
to overcome his weaknesses,

tries to run away from Misato.

lt's acceptable, however, considering
that he's only fourteen.

The organization brings the aimlessly
wandering Shinji back.

There are no kind words waiting
to ease his feelings,

except from the two boys.

Is he going to skip school again?

Little Shin's Room

Shinji, wake up! How long are you going
to keep skipping school?

It's been five days now. Unit 01 has
already been completely repaired.

So don't you think the pilot needs
to get his act together too?

Shinji?!

Miss Misato Katsuragi

He's run away.
I suppose that's not surprising.

Rain, After Running Away
Episode Four

Shinji?

Well...

We're Ikari's classmates,
Aida and Suzuhara, Ma'am.

Aida and Suzuhara?

Yes, Ma'am!

I'm Suzuhara.

Aren't you the boys who got in
Unit 01 's entry plug?

Yes, Ma'am!

We're sorry for causing so much trouble.

Actually, Ikari's been absent ever since then,

so we came to see if he was okay.

He's at the Nerv training facility right now.

Oh, I see.

These are the printouts that were
building up on Ikari's desk.

Oh, sorry for your trouble. Thank you.

Well, we'll be leaving now.

Please say "hi" to Ikari for us.

Yeah, I will. Bye.

This is an unexpected development.

She was a real babe, wasn't she?

Shinji, you idiot!

Idiot!

The next station is
Nagao Toge, Nagao Toge.

The exit will switch to the right side.

Thank you for using New Tokyo-3
Loop Seven.

This train will be going out of service
at this station.

Please, make sure you take all of your
belongings as you exit the train.

I've got to go back.

Hey there! We're offering you
a great bargain!

Hot young babes serving
heavenly refreshment!

Special services to heal your tired body,
services to fill you with energy!

You really couldn't detect it, Doctor?!!

Yes. An object only ten
millimeters in diameter

crashed into Antarctica at close
to the speed of light.

The technology we had was unable
to predict or prevent such a thing.

It's like hell out there! Just what is
the purpose of science?!

The atmospheric flux caused by the
change in the Earth's axis

has decreased by 3%.

So it's getting a little better?

No, there's still a tidal wave approaching
at 230 meters a second!

Doctor! We must evacuate!

It's my duty to remain here.

Doctor, choosing death is easy,

but you have an obligation
to watch this living hell!

He's only fourteen years old.

It seems so cruel, making him bear
the burden of mankind's destiny.

But we have no choice but to entrust the
piloting of the Evas to fourteen year olds.

I know.

So, has he called?

No?

No. I think he might never come back.

What are you going to do?

Nothing really.

If he won't come back,
maybe that's for the better.

Why?

After the battle the other day...

Why did you ignore my order?

I'm sorry.

I'm the one who's in charge
of your operations, right?

Yes.

You have a duty to obey my orders.
Do you understand?

Yes.

I'm warning you, never do it again.

Yes.

Do you really understand what I'm saying?!

Yes.

Hey, you're not going to get out of this
by just saying yes to everything I say.

I know that. That's enough, isn't it?
We won the battle anyway.

You know, it may seem easy to go along
with whatever anyone else wants,

but if you get into the Eva with that attitude,
it'll kill you!

I don't care.

It'd be nice if I could say you've got
the right attitude,

but if you expect to get any praise out of me,
you're wrong, Shinji Ikari.

That's not the point. In any case, I'm the
only one who can pilot it, aren't I?

I'll do it.

I see.

If piloting an Eva means nothing
but pain to him,

he shouldn't get into it again.

Otherwise, I'm sure he'll get killed.

But we need pilots.

Captain!

Aida, go on ahead!

But I can't go and leave you behind!

You fool!

Upsy-daisy.

Toji was sorry about that.

Toji was sorry about that.

He said that his kid sister scolded him

and said that, "It was the robot
who saved our lives!"

That's pretty embarrassing, being
chewed out by a grade school kid.

Right?

I like it at night because those
noisy cicadas don't chirp.

Although I remember that it was pretty quiet
when I was a kid,

there've been more of them each year.

The ecosystem is returning
to its former state.

That's what Miss Misato said.

I see, Miss Misato said so.

I really envy you.

Living with such a beautiful woman
and piloting the Evangelion.

I wish I could get behind
the controls just once!

You shouldn't. I think your mother
would be worried.

Oh, don't worry about that. I don't have one.

I'm the same as you.

You'll have something to eat, won't you?

Yeah.

Do you usually do this sort of thing?

Huh? Well, sure.

Is this some kind of training for
guerilla warfare or something?

How could I fight with toys like these?
It's just for fun.

You're Shinji Ikari, aren't you?

Yes.

We're from Nerv Security Intelligence.

Under Article 8 of the Security Act,
we're taking you to headquarters.

All right?

Yes.

And all you did was stand there?

That's easy for you to say!

But it's like I said, they were Nerv
Security Intelligence, professionals.

So what?! Don't you have any balls at all?!

Sissy!

Pervert!

Ape!

Only an idiot fights when
he knows he can't win.

Balls have nothing to do with it.

Long time, no see.

Yes.

Do you feel any better after wandering
around for two days?

I don't know.

The Eva is on standby. Will you pilot it?

Or won't you?

You're not going to scold me
for running away?

Of course not. I'm not related to you, am I?

If I say that I won't pilot Unit 01,
what will you do with it?

I suppose that Rei will do it.

Won't you pilot it?

It seems unrealistic for you
to force everything on her.

Don't worry. I'll pilot it.

But you don't want to do it?

Of course not. To begin with, it's not
something that comes to me naturally.

But Ayanami, Miss Misato and Miss Ritsuko...

Cut that out!

This has nothing to do with any of us!

If you don't like it, get out of here!

Just forget all about Eva and us and
go back to where you came from!

We don't need someone
with that attitude piloting!

The Third Child is leaving
New Tokyo-3 tomorrow.

Then we'll reconfigure
Unit 01 's system for Rei.

But...

Regardless of the results of Unit 00's
re-activation experiments,

we'll move on to experimenting with Unit 01.

According to the Marduk
Organization's report,

the Fourth Child hasn't been found yet.

That means we can't get
any pilot replacements?

Excuse me, where is Miss Misato?
I'd like to say goodbye.

You're no longer Nerv personnel.

Therefore, we can't give you any information.

Ikari!

You forgot this!

Could you excuse me for a moment?

Thank you.

Hey, Toji.

Come on, say something!

Ikari, I'm sorry I hit you twice.
Please, hit me back!

I can't do that.

Please! Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.

See? He's a pretty embarrassing guy,
isn't he?

But if it'll put an end to this dispute,
why don't you go ahead and hit him?

But...

Hurry up! You don't have
much time, do you?

Okay, but only once.

Okay! Come on!

Hold it!

No holdin' back.

Right.

Ouch...

How did you know I'd be here?

Call it a hunch. We've seen
dozens of classmates off now.

If you're leavin', we'll have to leave
this city sometime soon,

but we can't blame you for that.
We saw how you suffered in the Eva.

And if anyone tries to blame you,

I'm gonna give them a head butt!

Hey, don't look so gloomy.

Take care.

Good luck!

Well...

It's time.

I'm the one who deserves to be hit!

I'm a scoundrel, a coward,

spineless and weak...

Don't give us any more trouble.

Rei!

I see.

Rei Ayanami, age fourteen.

The first test subject chosen by
following the Marduk Report.

The First Child.

She is the designated pilot
for Evangelion Unit 00.

Her past has been eradicated. All
her personal records were erased.

So, what caused the accident
during the last experiment?

We still don't know.

However, we believe that
mental instability

on the part of the pilot was
a primary cause.

Mental instability? In Rei?

Yes, her mind became much more
disturbed than we had anticipated.

So, what did happen?

I don't know.

But she could have...

Did something occur to you?

No, that can't be it.

The demolition of block B-3
has been completed.

All technical department personnel

are to submit their data
to the analysis group.

So this is our enemy.

I see. Everything except the
core remains intact.

This is a perfect sample.

Thank you, this will help us a lot.

So, did you find anything new?

What the heck is this?

That's the code number for
"cannot be analyzed".

You mean, you don't know
what this is?

Correct. We do know the Angel
is composed of a type of matter

characterized by both particulate
and wave properties, like light.

But you've at least found its
power source, haven't you?

Something like that anyway.

But we haven't been able to figure
out any of its operating principles.

We've found something completely
outside our experience.

The world is filled with mysteries.

For example, take a look at this.

This is the Angel's inherent
wave pattern.

What? Let me see.

Could this be...

Yes. Although they are composed
of a different form of matter,

their actual composition,
in terms of the arrangement

and spacing of the pattern, falls
within a 99.89% match of humans.

Unbelievable, 99.89%.

We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

Bring it down... slowly...
We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

Okay!
We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

Okay!

Keep going. Stop.

This is the core?

How's the rest of it?

It's pretty deteriorated. We can't
expect to use it as a reference.

That's not a problem.
Dispose of the remnants.

Yes, Sir.

What's wrong?

Well, nothing's wrong.

Are you aware that when you
say "nothing" that way,

it's the same as asking others
to pay attention to you?

Well, it's just that my father seems
to have burned his hands.

Burned?

I was just wondering
how it happened.

Burns? Do you know anything
about those burns?

It was before you arrived at NERV.

Unit 00 went berserk during the
activation experiments.

You've heard about that, right?

Yes.

The pilot was trapped inside.

Ayanami was the pilot, wasn't she?

It was Commander lkari
who rescued her.

He opened the super-heated
hatch with his bare hands.

My father did that?

That's how he burned his hands.

Go, Hideko!

You lose!

You've got to treat us to
pizza if you lose!

There, go for it!

You won't make it!

Now, let's sink a shot!

Oh my gosh! Those guys
are looking at us!

Perverts!
Oh my gosh! Those guys
are looking at us!

Man, they've all got such
incredible breasts.

Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

Hi, Shinji!
Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

Hi, Shinji!

Hey, Big Shot!

What're you looking at so intently?

Nothing!

I think you're looking at
Ayanami! Right?

No!

Oh, come on, dude. Am I stupid?

Ayanami's boobs...

Ayanami's thighs...

Ayanami's...

...calves!

I told you, it's nothing like that.

Then, what were you looking at?

You can't fool me.

I was just wondering why
she's always alone.

Come to think of it,

she hasn't had any friends since
she started here in the 7th grade.

There's just something about her
that makes her hard to talk to.

She's probably just got
a lousy personality.

You're both Eva pilots, right? You
should know her better than us.

He's right.

Well, I've hardly spoken to her.

What is this?!

It's curry.

So you're still eating
this instant stuff.

Look, you're a guest, so you've
got no right to complain.

Here, Misato...

Oh, here.

Here, put all of that into this!

Are you serious?

Oh, don't you know how
good this is?

Okay...

Ordinary curry flavored instant
ramen can't compare to this!

Let's eat!

The trick is to put less hot
water in the soup.

Misato cooked this, didn't she?

Yes.
Misato cooked this, didn't she?

Yes.
Oh, can you tell?

Oh, can you tell?

Yes, by its taste.

How can she make something
ready-to-eat taste so awful?

Next time, invite me when
it's Shinji's turn to cook.

Shinji, you really ought to move.

You shouldn't let one bad
roommate ruin your life.

I'm used to it now.

He's right, Ritsuko.

Never underestimate the ability
of the human animal

to adapt to its environment.

And anyway, if he does move...

Shinji, why don't you bring
me another one, please?

Right.
Shinji, why don't you bring
me another one, please?

Right.
He's going to have to go through
a lot of trouble and red tape.

He's going to have to go through
a lot of trouble and red tape.

He just got his permanent
security card, you know.

Oh, I almost forgot!

Shinji, would you do me a favor?

What is it?

Rei Ayanami's renewal card.

I keep forgetting to
give this to her.

Would you mind delivering it
before you go to headquarters?

Sure.

What's the matter? You're staring
at Rei's picture, aren't you?

No!

Oh, I think you are, Shinji.

No!

Oh, come on! You're embarrassed,
aren't you?

Well, you've got an official excuse
to go to Rei's place now.

This is your chance, isn't it?

Stop teasing me!

But I love teasing you.
You always go ballistic!

Just like Misato.

I just find it strange that I know
so little about Ayanami,

even though we're both Eva pilots.

She's a very nice girl, but
she's like your father.

She's not very adept at...

Not adept at what?

Living.

Excuse me?

Excuse me, it's Shinji lkari.

I'm coming in, Miss Ayanami!

Are these hers?

Well...

I didn't mean...

Will you get off?

I...

What is it?

Well, I mean, I was...

I was asked to, so...

What was it? The card, your card...

It's been renewed!

So I was asked to deliver it.

I didn't mean for any of
this to happen.

Ritsuko said she forgot
to give it to you.

It's true. I rang your bell,
but there was no reply,

and the door was unlocked. So...

Central Dogma is currently
open to the public.

Group 3 should proceed directly
to the fourth gate.

This is your new card. Ritsuko
asked me to deliver it to you.

I'm sorry.

About what?

Aren't you going to have a
re-activation experiment today?

Say, aren't you scared?

Aren't you afraid of
piloting Unit 00?

Why?

I heard that you were hurt pretty
badly in an earlier experiment,

so I thought you might be...

Aren't you Commander lkari's son?

Yeah.

Don't you have faith in your
own father's work?

Of course not! How could
I trust him?

What?

Rei, are you all right?

Rei...

The pilot was trapped inside.

It was Commander lkari
who rescued her.

He opened the super-heated
hatch with his bare hands.

That's how he burned his hands.

Rei.

Can you hear me?

Yes.

We will now commence the Unit 00
re-activation experiment.

Commence first connection.

Shinji is saved, but after being
injured, he deteriorates rapidly.

Rei is forced to defend Shinji
in the heat of battle!

Meanwhile, Misato desperately
tries to pin-point

the Angel's weak spot with the
ultimate in heavy artillery.

Will Shinji's prayers and all
of Japan's energy

be enough to penetrate
the Angel's shields?

Unit 00 is fused by the
molten impact!

Just like the cruel angel

Young boy, become a legend

Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

You just look solely at me and smile

So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

The cruel angel's thesis

Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

With your torrent of ardent pathos

If you are to betray our memories

You, who embrace these heavens and shine

Young boy, become a legend

We're detecting a high energy reaction
from inside the target!

What?!

The circumference area is accelerating!
It's converging!

It can't be!

No, dodge it!

So, our probability of success is 8.7 percent.

It's quite a high percentage.

I see no reason to raise an objection.
You may proceed, Captain Katsuragi.

Yes, Sir.

But you sure have come up with
a reckless plan,

Operations Director Katsuragi.

Don't be rude. It's not reckless!

It can be executed within the

Don't show up half-asleep looking like that.

Sorry.

yesterday is apologizing.

Your meal.

I don't want to eat anything.

We'll be departing in sixty minutes.

Do I have to pilot that thing again?

Yes, you do.

I don't want to.

Maybe you can be so cool about it,

because you haven't had the kind
of experiences I've had yet.

I don't want to go through that again.

Then why don't you stay in bed?

Stay in bed?

I'll pilot Unit 01.

So it'll be okay?

Theoretically, yes.

However, we won't know if the cannon barrel
and accelerator will hold until we try firing it.

This is the first time it's been fired
with such a high power output.

Here are your individual duties
for the operation.

Shinji...

Yes, Ma'am.
Shinji...

Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

Yes, Ma'am.

Rei, you're in charge of defense with Unit 00.

Yes, Ma'am.

This is because Shinji has a higher
sync ratio with Unit 01,

and this operation will require
exceptional precision.

Since the positron beam will be
influenced by the Earth's gravity,

magnetic fields and rotation,
it will not fire in a straight line.

You must remember to make
adjustments for these deviations.

You must penetrate the core precisely.

But I've never practiced this!

Don't worry.

Just do what the manual says.

When the indicators converge
in the center, pull the trigger.

The computers will handle the rest.

Also, once you fire it,

it will take time before you can fire again

for cooling, reloading,
and replacement of the fuses.

Then, if I miss and the enemy shoots back...

Don't think about unnecessary
things right now.

Just think about destroying it in one shot.

So it's crisis time.

I...

I just need to defend Unit 01, correct?

That's right.

Understood.

It's time. Both of you, get changed.

Yes, Ma'am.

We might die doing this.

Why do you say that?

You won't die.

Because I'll protect you.

...a large-scale power outage all across...

Why do you pilot this thing?

Because I'm bound.

Bound?

Yes, it's a bond.

Knocks on the door to your heart

And smile oh so gently

You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

I'm in your debt again.

But you don't intend to repay it.

About the Intel they were pursuing
using the Freedom of Information Act...

I mixed in some fake items
to throw them off the scent.

The government is working on
legislation behind the scenes,

but that should be derailed soon.

Now, about that other project...
Do you want me to handle it?

No, judging from the files you sent,
it shouldn't pose any problems.

We'll stick to the scenario, then.

Good morning.

Morning...

This is how you get the day started!

Don't most people drink coffee?

Ever since old times,
Japanese people have had

white rice, miso soup,
and sake in the morning.

-That's in your case, right, Ms. Misato?
-Why the attitude?

Whose turn was it
to cook breakfast this morning?

I think I know why you're
still single at your age.

Well, excuse me for being so uncouth.

And being a slob.

Okay, you've made your point!

Thanks, I'm done.

Are you really coming to school today?

Of course I am.
It's for your future plans meeting.

But you're really busy at work.

It's fine, it's fine.
It's all part of the job.

Your job, huh?

Hello?

Hi! You didn't have to
come all the way over.

Sure, we'll be right out.

Ms. Misato, please don't come
to the door like that.

-It's embarrassing.
-Have it your way.

Good morning, Mr. Ikari!

Bye, Ms. Misato! We're off to school!

Have a nice day!

Come on, let's get going!

Snark, huh?

Well, I guess it's a good sign
that he's finally loosened up.

Ma'am?

He just left the apartment.
Maintain security on him.

Look, she's here!

She's so hot! Who is she?!

Ikari's guardian?

You mean a babe like that looks after him?

Horny idiots.

Is Ms. Misato great or what?

You think so?

All that, and she's Nerv's
Operations Director! That's amazing!

You think so?

It's a good thing for us that Shinji
is such a clueless baby, Kensuke.

Yeah, he won't get in our way.

Tohji and Kensuke don't know
how big a slob she is.

Oh, I wish I could land a woman like her!

I think you'd regret it.

You are one dense dude, big guy.

Right! We'll leave peace on Earth
in your capable hands!

So you can rest easy,
knowing that Ms. Misato is in ours!

Unit 01 has met target cooling values.
Proceed to stage two.

Peace on Earth, huh?
That's what the Evas are for...

But what are they?

It smells like blood in the entry plug.

So why do I feel so safe in here?

When it's all said and done,
I have no idea what's going on.

How are Unit Zero's
organic chest components?

Badly damaged.

We're making new ones, but it's eating up
what's left of our supplemental budget.

Maybe things will get a little easier
once Unit Two arrives from Germany.

It might be just the opposite.

Angel disposal operations up there
also cost money.

No kidding. This place is
always strapped for funds.

The fate of humanity
is riding on us, for Pete's sake.

It is what it is.
"Man does not live by Eva alone."

It takes money
to keep the survivors alive.

Speaking of budgets...
The Commander is off at another meeting?

Yes, he's en route right now.

Things are so much calmer here
when the Commander is away.

Excuse me. Do you mind if I sit here
since we're traveling together?

The revised budget earmarked for sample
collection was approved without comment.

The Council places a premium
on their own survival.

That goal loosens their purse strings.

Yes, their argument was always
that the Angels wouldn't reappear.

One other piece of good news:

All council nations, minus the US,
have approved funding for Eva-06.

Well, it's only a matter of time
before the Americans sign on, too.

They have a powerful aversion
to high unemployment rates.

What about yours?

We will take part, starting with Unit 08.

Phase Two of the Buildup Plan
is still in effect, after all.

Mind you, there is still the issue
of us not having a pilot for it yet.

The Angels have returned.

Our only path forward is to defeat them.

Yes, I would also rather not have
a repeat of the Second Impact.

Wait, you're saying the Second Impact,
when Antarctica was vaporized--

Yes. The textbooks say it was a tragedy
caused by a massive meteorite impact,

but the truth has a tendency
to be covered up.

Fifteen years ago in Antarctica,

humanity found a humanoid object,
the first of what we call Angels.

But while studying it, there was
a huge explosion of unknown cause.

That is the truth behind
the Second Impact.

So what we're doing here--

Is preventing the onset
of a probable Third Impact.

That is why Nerv
and the Evangelions exist.

By the way, it looks like they're
going ahead with it tomorrow.

Understood.

Good morning.

Um, good morning, ma'am.

I'm going to Old Tokyo for work.

I won't be back until late,
so go grab something for dinner.

Bye.

Um... Yes, ma'am.

DERELICT ZONE NO. 28
(CITY CENTER OF OLD TOKYO)

It's hard to believe that this
was ever called a bustling metropolis.

We're there.

Why are they doing this here,
of all places?

So, is the SSDF involved in this project?

The Strategic Self Defense Force?
No, there's no sign they're involved.

That explains why they're
getting away with all this.

The Japan Heavy
and Chemical Industries Consortium

thanks you for taking the time
out of your busy schedules today

to attend this demonstration.

You will all be invited to view
the public trials from the control room.

But if anyone has any questions,
I will be happy to answer them.

-Here!
-Ah, the renowned Dr. Ritsuko Akagi!

We're honored by your presence.

May I ask a few questions?

By all means, ask away.

According to your presentation,
the unit has an internal heat engine.

Yes, that is its major feature.

It is guaranteed to be able to
operate continuously for 150 days.

I believe installing a reactor
inside a ground combat weapon

meant for close-quarters combat
poses too great a safety risk.

It is more useful than a "decisive weapon"
that can't even run for five minutes.

Remote operation poses issues
when faced with emergencies.

We consider it much more humane
than placing undue strain on pilots

and exposing them to
psychological contamination.

Enough, already. You're causing a scene.

And deliberate operator malfeasance?

It's safer than a wildly dangerous
weapon that can go out of control

and go on a rampage
at the drop of a hat, I'd say.

A weapon that can't be controlled
is utter nonsense.

It's like hysterical women.

There's no reasoning with them.

That is why we have pilots and technology!

Come now, are you claiming
that science and the human heart

can keep those monsters under control?

Are you serious?

Yes. Completely.

Nerv's reliance on something
as nebulous as the human heart

is what let that rampage
happen on their watch.

As a result, the UN was hit
with a huge extra budget request.

Money that could have fed
20,000 starving people elsewhere.

Plus, even though it was
such a serious incident,

its cause remains a mystery?

One would hope that you would carry out
your duties as the responsible party.

Isn't it nice how Nerv
enjoys extralegal protection?

You aren't held responsible
for your failings.

Say what you like,

but only Nerv's main weapon is capable
of defeating the hostile entities!

Are you referring to the A.T. Field?
We'll have that licked eventually.

Nerv's reign won't last forever.

NERV PARTY

Stupid! Jerk!
That obnoxious son of a b****!

They're just getting even with us
for cutting them out of the action!

I am so pissed off!

Enough, already. You're causing a scene.

He's tooting his own horn
and wants to be patted on the back.

What a pathetic little man.

But how did they even
know about A.T. Fields?!

Our secrets are leaking like a sieve.

The Intelligence Department
needs to do its d*** job!

We will now begin
the activation test of the JA.

There is absolutely no danger.

Observe from that window
knowing that you are perfectly safe.

Ready for activation!

-Begin test!
-All power systems engaged!

-Pressure values normal.
-Coolant pump system shows green.

-Control rods, full withdrawal!
-Power has reached critical.

Power output, nominal!

Begin walking cycle!

Walk ahead, slow! Right foot forward!

Roger. Walk ahead, slow!
Right foot forward!

Balance stable! Power system shows green!

Roger!

Proceeding to left foot forward!
Steady as she goes!

It's actually walking. I suppose they
do have something to brag about.

What is it?

This is strange.
Pressure inside the reactor is climbing!

Primary coolant loop temperatures rising!

Open valves. Inject moderators!

It's not working!
Pump output is not rising!

D***. Power it down. Emergency shutdown!

-Shutdown signal sent!
-Signal not received!

-Radio channel also dead!
-Control has been lost!

This can't be happening...

This robot is just as big a jerk
as its creator.

Abnormalities in pressurizer!

Control rod mechanism fail!

At this rate, there is a risk
of a core meltdown!

I can't believe it...

The JA's programming
is supposed to anticipate

and deal with any possible contingency.

This situation shouldn't be possible.

And yet we're looking at
an impending core meltdown!

The only thing we can still do
is wait for it to shut down on its own.

What are the odds of that?

They're 0.00002%. It would take a miracle.

I prefer desperate action over waiting for
a miracle. Tell me how to shut it down!

We've tried everything!

No, I bet there's still a last resort,
a command to wipe the whole thing.

Give me that password.

Total program deletion is top secret.

It's not my call to make.
I don't have the authority to tell you.

Then get the authority! Right now!

Yes, it's me. Get me Mr. Manda in Tokyo-2.

Yes, the Home Ministry Director.

Oh, you mean that.
I delegated all that to Yasugi.

Ask him.

A decision that big
can't be made over the phone!

Can you send me
a formal request in writing?

Then if I get permission from
Mr. Yoshizawa, you'll approve?

Yes, I have Mr. Witz's approval already.

-Yes. Yes, thank you.
-They're all passing the buck.

Official orders are on their way.
This has to be done properly.

That won't cut it! It won't do any good
if they come after that thing blows!

Jet Alone is currently
heading towards Atsugi.

We're out of time.
I'm taking action on my own authority.

No offense.

Hello, Hyuga?
I've worked things out with Atsugi,

so send Shinji and Unit 01
over here with Type F gear.

Right, it's an emergency.

You'll never pull it off.
Forget it, Capt. Katsuragi.

Anyway, how would you even
go about stopping it?

Up close and personal. By hand.

Are you serious?

Yes.

But the interior is already flooded
with contamination. It's too dangerous.

If this works, it will save everyone.

You'll be able to manually open the hatch
once the command signal from us stops.

You can get inside
through the backpack rig.

"Hope."

That's the password for
full program deletion.

Thanks.

Our target is the JA. There's a risk of a
reactor meltdown in the next five minutes.

So we can't let it come any closer
to a population center.

-Hyuga?
-Ma'am?

Once you cut the Eva loose,
get clear and climb to a safe altitude.

-Roger.
-Shinji?

Yes, ma'am?

Run alongside the target
and put me onto its back.

After that, try to stall the JA
any way you can.

You're going inside that thing?!

-Right.
-That's nuts!

Trust me, I know.
It's our best shot, though.

But it's too dangerous!

Don't worry. Your Eva will be fine
even if it blows up in your face.

That's not what I meant!
It's too dangerous for you!

Well, we have to do everything we can.

It wouldn't sit right otherwise, right?

I have eyes on the target!

Okay, let's go.

Eva drop zone reached!

-Release docking lock!
-Roger.

-We've caught up!
-Less than four minutes to go!

Grab onto it!

Don't worry! Just set me up there!

Ms. Misato!

Be careful.

Wow, that's hot! This doesn't look good.

Stop, d*** it!

Ms. Misato, hurry!

This is it.

HOPE

"Error"? What's the deal?

There's no other explanation.
The program's been tampered with!

Reactor will hit prompt criticality
in zero point two!

Control rods aren't activating!

Here goes nothing.

Ms. Misato! Get out of there!

D*** it, move! You piece of...

Ms. Misato!

Zero point one to prompt criticality!

It's no use, it's going to blow!

-We failed...
-Ms. Misato!

She did it!

-Pressure down!
-All readings normal!

-We're saved!
-She did it!

She did it!

That fool...

Ms. Misato, are you all right?

Ms. Misato!

Yeah, but I feel like crap...

Thank goodness! You're okay, then?

Wow, that's great... What a relief.

You were amazing!
I was so wrong about you!

A miracle really did happen!

Yeah.

But this little miracle
was arranged by someone.

Unit 01 has been retrieved safely.
There's no danger of contamination.

Aside from Capt. Katsuragi's actions,
everything went according to scenario.

Well done.

Morning...

Next up, a nice morning shower!

Where did I leave my bra and panties?

Good morning, Mr. Ikari!

Yeah, good morning.

See you later!

Have a nice day!

Ms. Misato is so cool...

I thought so, too,
but she's so embarrassing at home!

She's sloppy, dresses like a bum,
and is a complete slob!

Watching her act like that
makes me cringe!

That makes me extra jealous.

How come?

-You're such a baby, Ikari.
-You said it!

And why is that?

That's the real Misato,
the one we outsiders never see.

That means you're family.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

Yes. That issue has already been
worked out with the Council.

The package left Sasebo yesterday
and is currently on the Pacific.

An Mi-55d transport chopper!

I never thought I'd get the chance
to actually ride in one!

Like they say, "Good friends are
a great blessing"! Right, Shinji?

You must be going stir crazy,
being stuck in the mountains every day.

So I thought I'd invite you
all out on a Sunday date.

You mean this is an honest
to goodness date, Ms. Misato?

I bought this hat on the off chance
that this day would come, Ms. Misato!

So, where are we going?

To enjoy a lovely cruise
on the Pacific aboard a luxury liner.

Five carriers!

Four battleships! It's a huge fleet!

Yep, good friends are a great blessing!

She calls that a luxury liner?

What it is is gorgeous!

That's the carrier that's the pride
of the UN fleet, the Over the Rainbow!

It's huge!

I'm amazed that
that old relic can stay afloat.

It's no relic!
It's a pre-Second Impact classic!

The nerve of these jackasses!

Their toy needed a special plug,
so they had one delivered!

Like some d*** errand boys!

Oh, cool!

This is just too cool!

It's enough to bring tears
to a man's eyes!

Oh, cool!

Hey! Come back here!

D*** it! Stop! Hold it!

Hello, Misato. How have you been?

Not bad. Hey, have you grown in height?

Yep. And I'm filling out
in all the right places, too.

Allow me to introduce the Second Children,
Evangelion Unit 02's designated pilot.

Asuka Langley Soryu.

What the heck was that for?!

Admission for the show.
I'd call that a bargain.

Say what?!
Okay then, I'll return the favor!

What do you think you're doing?!

So, which one is the Third Children
that I keep hearing about?

Don't tell me it's this sleazebag!

No. This is him.

Doesn't seem like much.

Ah, I assumed you were a tour guide
who was escorting some Boy Scouts.

But it seems I was wrong.
I apologize for the misunderstanding.

Thank you for being
so understanding, Captain.

Not at all.

I haven't had the pleasure of looking
after someone else's children in ages.

Thank you for your cooperation
in transporting Eva-02.

Here are the specifications
for the emergency electrical plug.

Humph. I never received
any official request to allow

that doll run around here at sea.

Perhaps you could think of it as
a precaution in case of emergency.

The Pacific Fleet is escorting it
in the event of that emergency.

When did the UN Forces
become a delivery service?

As I recall, it was just after
a certain agency was founded, sir.

This is quite an escort
to deliver a single toy.

The entire Pacific Fleet is here.

Given the importance of the Evangelions,
I'd say this isn't enough.

-Now, if you'll sign this form.
-Not yet.

Eva-02 and its pilot were entrusted
to this fleet by Germany's Third Branch.

I won't stand for you bossing me around!

When will you relinquish them, then?

After they have been unloaded
at New Yokosuka.

The high seas are our jurisdiction.
You will do as you're told here.

Very well.

But remember that in an emergency,
Nerv's authority supersedes yours.

-What a badass!
-She's acting like Ms. Ritsuko...

Dignified as ever, I see.

Kaji-senpai!

Hello.

Kaji! I don't recall inviting you
up to the bridge!

My apologies.

-If you'll excuse us.
-This is a date?

-Please see us to New Yokosuka.
-This is too cool!

S***! A bunch of kids
are supposed to save the world?

Times have changed, sir.

I hear that Congress has high hopes
for those robots as well.

For those toys? Those d*** fools!

If they have that kind of cash,
it would be better spent on us!

What the heck are you doing here?!

I'm her plus-one. Germany sent me along.

How could I have missed this?
This situation was entirely plausible!

Hey! Watch the hands!

I can't help it!

Flight Three has launched on schedule...

So... You seeing anyone?

And just how is that any of your business?

Ouch! Why the cold shoulder?

So, I hear you're living with Katsuragi?

Um, that's right.

She used to flop around in her sleep.
She still do that?

Wha-- Wha--

What are you talking about?!

I take it she hasn't changed,
has she, Shinji Ikari?

Um, no. Hey, how did you know my name?

Why wouldn't I?

In our world, you're a celebrity.

The Third Children, the boy who piloted
an Eva without any prior training.

Come on, that was just luck.

Luck is part of destiny.
You have a gift, pure and simple.

-Well, I'll see you later.
-Yes, sir.

This is a sick joke... A nightmare.

So, what do you think of Shinji Ikari?

He's a letdown.

A guy like him, picked to be
the Third Children? I'm disillusioned.

He got tossed unprepared into a fight,
but his synch rate easily topped 40.

No way!

Man, that captain
was a real piece of work!

He's a proud man.

Anyone would make a snide
remark or two in his situation.

Mr. Kaji sure seems like
a fun and interesting person.

He hasn't changed one bit,
that d*** moron!

Third Children!

Come with me for a minute.

Wow, Unit 02 is red. I had no idea.

It's not just the paint job
that makes it special.

Units 00 and 01 are really just

a developmental-use
prototype and test type.

The fact that you could synch with yours
without any training proves it.

But Unit 02 here is different!

Mine was built for combat operations,
the world's first real Evangelion!

It's the official type!

What was that?

An underwater shock wave!

That blast was nearby.

Is there...

-Oh, no! An Angel?!
-That's an actual Angel?

What do we do? We have to go
back to where Ms. Misato is!

Here's my chance!

All ships, take evasive action!
Mind your distance!

Where's that sit-rep?!

Cymbeline is dead in the water!
Titus Andronicus cannot locate target!

D*** it, what's going on out there?

Hello! Nerv here!

Would you like Intel on this unseen enemy
and how to effectively deal with it?

We're in combat!
Bystanders aren't allowed on the bridge!

This is just my personal opinion, but this
certainly looks like an Angel attack.

-All ships, engage target at will!
-You're wasting your time...

It's not enough to punch
through an A.T. Field, huh?

But why would an Angel come here?

Is it after Unit 02?!

Hey! Where are we going?!

Wait up here. I'll be right back.

Why is she so bossy?

Don't peek, you pervert!

Why are guys always so stupid and horny?!

Okay, Asuka... it's game time.

Why can't we sink it?!

I guess only an Eva can beat those things.

Okay, let's get out there.

You, too! You're coming with me!

Hey, why did we get changed
into plug suits?!

Are you an idiot?

Why do you think? We're going to
take that thing out with my Unit 02!

Is that okay? Shouldn't we get
Ms. Misato's permission?

I'll get her permission after my victory.

Okay, I'm going to show you
how a real pilot does it.

But don't cause any trouble, got it?

That's strange... It's almost
like it's looking for something.

Getting attacked by an Angel out here
wasn't part of the deal.

That is why Unit 02 is there.
I even sent a backup pilot.

If it comes down to it,
escape on your own.

Understood.

[speaking German]

There's a bug. What's wrong?

Cognitive noise!
I told you not to cause trouble, didn't I?

What did I do?

You're thinking in Japanese, aren't you?
Think in German, d*** it!

Oh, okay...

Um, Baumkuchen--

Idiot! All right, fine!

Change cognitive linguistics!
Set basic to Japanese!

Evangelion Unit 02! Activate!

Message from the Othello:
Eva-02 is activating!

It's what?!

Way to go, Asuka!

Don't! Abort activation! Power it down!

Forget him, Asuka! Launch!

How dare you!

We have jurisdiction over the Eva
and its pilot! You will do as you're told!

Are you kidding?! This is an emergency!
Protocol can take a hike!

Hey!

Is she serious?
Unit 02 is still in its Type B loadout.

Won't we be in trouble
if we fall into the ocean?

So we don't fall in.

-You're in there too, Shinji?!
-Yes, ma'am.

There are two kids in there?!

May as well test it out...

Asuka! Launch now!

-Here it comes!
-We're on our way!

-Where is it?
-Over there!

-We only have 58 seconds!
-I know that!

Misato, have the emergency
power cable waiting on the deck!

-You got it!
-What's she trying to do?

-Right. Time to fly.
-Fly?

-Auxiliary power online!
-Direct feed to reactor established!

-Clear the flight deck!
-Ready for Eva landing!

-All hands, brace for impact!
-They're all lunatics!

Eva-02, coming in for landing!

What a waste...

Target closing in fast!

Here it comes! To port, nine o'clock!

Switching to external power!

Switchover complete!

-We don't have any weapons...
-A Prog Knife is all I need!

-That's thing's pretty big...
-Just like I hoped it would be!

What are they planning to do?

Close-quarters combat is
the best way to defeat an Angel.

Way to stop that thing, Asuka!

You've got to be kidding!
They're trashing my flight deck!

They fell in!

Asuka, you can't fight underwater
in that Type B configuration!

You never know until you try, right?

-What a horrible waste...
-Remaining cable length?

Down to 1,200!

-What are you going to do?
-They'll come up with something.

We have to come up with something!

You're almost out of cable!
Brace for impact!

D*** it!

Eva has lost the target!

How can I run out of disks
at a time like this?!

A Yak-38i!

-Hey there, Katsuragi!
-Kaji!

I have a delivery to make,
so I'll see you there.

Take us up.

Take care of things here, Capt. Katsuragi!

H-He bailed on us!

Target re-approaching the Eva!

Here it comes again!
I'll nail it for sure this time!

What the heck?! It's not moving!

We can't in Type B gear.

-What are we gonna do?
-You're asking me?

What a wimp! Aren't you supposed
to be the great Third Children?!

Here it comes!

A mouth?!

Yeah, it's an Angel...

Eva-02 has entered the target!

You mean they got eaten?

Man, it's like we're fishing!

Fishing? Yes! We'll go fishing!

-Out of the fire, back to the frying pan.
-Oh, who asked you?!

And get off me, you pervert!

But we have to break free somehow!

Asuka? Do you read me?

Whatever you do, don't let go!

-Captain.
-What?

I need your assistance.

Having my two surviving battleships
fire at point-blank range?!

Yes.

We scuttle the two evacuated battleships

along the umbilical cable to set the trap.

As they are sinking,
Eva-02 will pry open the target's mouth.

Both ships will enter it.

Then, after firing at point-blank range,
they will self-destruct,

thereby destroying the target.

That's insane!

This plan may be insane,
but I don't think it's impossible.

Very well.

All hands, abandon ship!
I say again, all hands, abandon ship!

All frigates, move in to rescue the crew!

But what about the Eva?

Don't worry. Those two will be fine.

Hey! Stop manhandling my Unit 02!

Okay, you two! Are you clear on the plan?

-We'll make it work somehow.
-We're counting on you!

Ships' Kingston valves have been pulled.
Now sinking towards Z-point.

Roger. Reel in the cable!

Eva starting to ascend! Contact in 70!

D*** it, stop messing with
the controls! Move aside!

But if we don't pry its mouth open,
we're gonna get blown up with it!

Contact in 60!

-The Angel's mouth?!
-Still closed!

Both battleships are sinking
towards the target.

Eva still ascending! Contact in 50!

-It's not working!
-We're almost out of time!

Target has passed beneath the Tempest!

There's not much time! Hurry!

-Don't get any funny ideas in your head.
-As if!

-Anyway, just concentrate!
-I know!

Contact in 20!

Contact in 15!

Open!

Open!

Open fire!

NEW YOKOSUKA (FORMERLY ODAWARA)

You made another mess, I see.

I really should have factored in
underwater combat.

That's unusual. Is that regret?

It's all good. At least we got
some valuable data out of it.

That's true.

Misato?

This really is valuable.

-M-Matching outfits!
-Rubs me the wrong way!

This is a new synchronization record!

It was just for seven seconds, so it was
probably just a rush of adrenaline.

Hey! Where's Mr. Kaji?

He ran off without us!
He's at HQ already, that jerk!

I must say, that was
quite the eventful voyage.

It was because of this, wasn't it?

Look at how far it's reconstituted itself.

It's encased in solidified Bakelite,
but it's alive. Without a doubt.

It's the key to the Human
Instrumentality Project.

Yes. This is the first human being.

This is Adam.

She might have been cute,
but, man, what a shrew!

Well, we'll never see her again.

But you're stuck with her
because of your job, big guy.

You have our sympathies, seriously.

I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. Nice to meet you.

29.970

Hey, have you seen her yet?

Oh, yeah! Yeah!

Seen who?

You dork, you haven't seen
the foreign girl yet?

Foreign girl?

Yeah, she's in 8th grade, Class A.

She just transferred
here last week.

She's hot!

Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu,
did you know that?

Yeah, she's so cute.

Since she was raised over
there but born here,

do you think she already
has a boyfriend?

Don't be stupid!

I bet she broke up in Germany,
and she's here in a foreign land

with a heart that can't be mended.

Oh my gosh...

Did you hear all the cat talk?

Asuka! Asuka!

They're just ignorant.

Thank you, come again.

At least the pictures don't
reveal her personality.

Hello!

Shinji!

Guten Morgen!

Guten Morgen.

Hey, why so gloomy? This is the
gorgeous Asuka greeting you!

You should appreciate your
good fortune!

I'm the most popular
girl in school!

Hey, the other one's
here too, isn't she?

Other one?

What are you, stupid? I'm talking
about the First Child, of course!

Oh, Ayanami...

Hello!

You must be Rei Ayanami,
the pilot of the prototype.

I'm Asuka! Asuka Langley Sohryu.

I'm the designated pilot of Eva
Unit 02. Let's be good friends!

Why?

Because it'd be convenient.
You know what I mean?

If I'm ordered to, I will.

Talk about odd.

I'll say. Are only weirdos
chosen to be pilots?

You've lost some weight.

Is that so?

You must be enduring an
unrequited love.

How did you know?

Because...

"A woman with a mole in the
pathway of her tears

is destined to a life full of them."

If you're trying to put a move on
me, I'm afraid you can't.

There's a very ugly face
observing us.

Long time no see, Kaji.

It's been a while.

You're a little less discreet
than I expected.

He hasn't ever been
discreet in his life!

You've handed over Unit 02,
right? You should be leaving now!

I just received orders this morning
that I'll be staying here on loan.

So we can hang around again,

just like we used to.

You've got to be kidding!

Enemy attack?!

We just got this report from
the battle cruiser Haruna.

"Huge submerged object detected
off Ki'i peninsula. Sending data."

The data has been collated
and examined.

Wavelength pattern Blue.
Confirmed to be an Angel.

All personnel, go to
first stage alert.

The recent battle severely
damaged the intercept system.

Only twenty-six percent of our
defense capability is available.

And our operational capability for
actual combat is virtually nil.

Therefore, we're going to have
to intercept the target

at the water's edge, right
before it makes landfall!

Units 01 and 02 will mount an
attack in a series of waves.

In other words, close in
and take turns.

Roger.

This sucks. My Japanese debut,
and she won't let me solo.

Why do I have to bring you?!

It can't be helped.
Procedures, you know?

Well, let me tell you something,
just don't get in my way!

His selection as a pilot must
have been a joke, right?

Two against one is not what I call
a fair fight. It's not fair.

We don't get a choice.

Survival takes priority.

There!

Commence attack!

I'll handle this Angel!
You cover me!

Cover you?

Ladies first!

Damn it, don't give me orders,
you dumb rookie!

Charge!

That wasn't bad.

What did you think of that,
Third Child?!

A fight should be clean, elegant
and without waste.

What's this crap?

Today, at 10:58:15 AM,

Unit 01 was attacked
by Target Alpha,

which separated from the target
submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.

At the same time, plus 20 seconds,
Unit 02 was halted by Target Beta.

We have a comment from
E-Project chairperson.

This is pathetic.

This is all your fault! You totally
screwed up my debut battle!

What are you talking about?

You're the one who charged in
there acting like an idiot!

Idiot?! How dare you call me that?
Pathetic excuse for a combat pilot!

You're just a jerk!

Look in the mirror!

In your rush to show off, you
completely ignored procedures!
Look in the mirror!

In your rush to show off, you
completely ignored procedures!

What was that? You look
like a drowned rat!

At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned
the operation
What was that? You look
like a drowned rat!

At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned
the operation
You can't say that kind
of thing to me!

You can't say that kind
of thing to me!

and transferred command to
the UN Secondary Force.

We've been humiliated.

At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made
an attack with an N2 mine.

We'll have to re-draw
the map again.

They succeeded in burning off 28%
of target's structural substance.

Did they kill it?
They succeeded in burning off 28%
of target's structural substance.

Did they kill it?
This is merely temporary relief. A
second attack is a matter of time.

This is merely temporary relief. A
second attack is a matter of time.

At least we have time to regroup.
You can't ask for more than that.

Listen up, you two.

Do you know what your job is?

Piloting Eva.

No! Your job is to defeat
the Angels.

NERV does not exist to make
grotesque displays like this.

Therefore, you two
must cooperate.

Why should we?!

Enough already.

Why does everyone get
so angry here?

It's because adults are much too
aware of their credibility.

Where's Misato?

Clearing things up. The person in
charge must take responsibility.

Here are the internal protests
and damage reports.

This is a bill from the UN,

and here you have complaints
from the PR department as well.

Read them all.

I can tell what they say
without looking.

"If you're going to fight,
don't do it here," right?

Good guess.

I'll do it as soon as we take
care of this Angel.

I swear I will destroy that Angel.

The Vice Commander
is pretty angry.

You'll almost certainly be demoted
if you embarrass him again.

It was good luck within bad luck
that Commander lkari wasn't here.

If he'd been here, you'd have been
fired before he ever saw these.

So, have you brought me an
idea to help save my job?

Just one.

I thank you, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

It's good to have a friend
one can count on.

However, I'm not the one who'll
be saving my old friend.

This is Kaji's idea.

Kaji?

I'm home! Not that anyone's
here, of course, but...

What is this?!

Don't be so rude!

Those are my personal
belongings!

You! What in the blazes are
you doing in my house?

Why are you still here?

Still here?

You've been dumped for
the new model!

Misato will be living with me.

That's a more logical choice when
you consider my superior abilities.

Although honestly, I'd
rather live with Kaji.

Say, just why are Japanese
houses so small anyway?

Not even half of my stuff fits!

And the Japanese sure don't
have any sense of privacy.

How can they live in a room
without locks? Unbelievable!

It's because the Japanese way

is to consider the priorities and
needs of others before one's own.

Misato!

How are you? You two are going
to get along real well, right?

What do you mean?

This is all preparation for
the next operation.

Say what?

There is only one way to destroy
the seventh Angel!

A simultaneous two-point attack
on each target's core

while its components
are separated.

In other words, an attack by two
Evas with synchronized timing.

Cooperation and coordination
between you will be paramount.

Therefore, I want the two
of you to live together.

No way!

A boy and girl should never sleep
together after the age of seven!
No way!

A boy and girl should never sleep
together after the age of seven!

The Angel is currently
restoring itself.

It will begin its second assault
in six days, so there's no time.

But it's impossible.

Now, we have a way to
make it possible!

The master attack pattern will be
choreographed using this music.

In six days, as soon as possible.

I'm worried about Shinji.

He's been gone three days, right?

Hey, there's the class rep.

Two of the three stooges.

Why are you here?

To offer condolences to Miss
Sohryu. What about you two?

To offer condolences to lkari.

Why did you stop here?

Yes?

You've betrayed us!

You look like two peas in a pod.

I can't believe this!

Neither can we. It's all
Misato's fault!

We have to eat, breathe
and sleep together!

You're living in sin! How awful!

No, it's not like that!

Then, just what is it like?

Hi, welcome everybody!

Why don't you explain
all this to us?

You should have told us that first.

How is the coordination coming?

Well, as you can see.

Well, so much for synchronization!

I could never sink to the pathetic
level this animated turnip lives at!

If you ask me, this whole
idea is impossible!

Then you give up?

But you don't have anyone
else, do you?

Rei?

Yes, Ma'am.
Rei?

Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?

Why don't you try?

Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?

Yes, Ma'am.

It looks like I should alter the
operation to pair Shinji and Rei.

No! I can't stand this!
I can't take it anymore!

Asuka!

Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Asuka!

Even the Devil cries sometimes.

Ikari!

You've got to follow her!

You made her cry! It's your fault!

Well...

Don't say anything.
Well...

Don't say anything.

I know.

I have to pilot the Eva.
I've got no choice.

I'll do it.

No matter what, I'll put Rei
and Misato to shame!

You don't have to squash them.

You're being too simplistic,
even if you are a man!

I must avenge myself.

My pride...

It's a matter of honor
now, you see?

Where's Misato?

At work. She called earlier.
She'll be there all night.

So that means we're
all alone tonight.

This is the impenetrable "Wall
of Jericho", Third Child.

Take one step over this wall
and you'll be a dead man.

And now, it's time for children
to go to bed!

Why do the Japanese sleep on
the floor? This is so stupid.

Mama...

Mama...

You're just a child yourself.

No, somebody will see us.

Who's watching?

Someb...
Who's watching?

Someb...

No! There's nothing
between us anymore.

Don't do that again.

But your lips didn't say no.

Which one should I trust?

Your lips or your words?

There you go.

Thanks.

You're unusually sober today.

Yeah, a little.

Work? Or a man?

A lot of things.

Still in love?

Don't be ridiculous!

Who'd want that idiot?!

I was young, and it's still the
biggest blemish on my whole life.

I meant that he may still like you.
Did I scare you?

Why you lousy...

You're only proving
my hypothesis.

Why don't you go with
your feelings?

It's not like it's still
eight years ago.

It hasn't changed. Not a bit.
He's still immature.

Well, I've got to get to work.
Tomorrow is D-day.

Target has broken through the
final defense line at Gora.

Here it comes!

We won't fail this time!

Spread your ATfields as soon
as the music starts.

Then follow the operation
choreography.

Are you two ready?

Roger!

The target has entered
the mountains.

Just remember Shinji, full power,
maximum performance.

I know that. We'll finish in
sixty-two seconds.

Target entering Ground Zero.

Detach external power cables.

Launch.

Confirmation. Both Evas
are operational.

Geez...

This is pathetic.

You jerk! What are you doing
on my Unit 02?!

What are you talking about?
You're the one who fell on me!

You're the one who lost
his timing first!

You're always so slow!

What were you doing, staying
up so late last night?!

Image training for today's battle!

Liar! I know you tried to kiss
me while I was sleeping!

You cheat! You were awake?

Oh, my gosh! I was just kidding!
Did you really kiss me?!

No, I didn't! I stopped!

Pervert! Fiend! Idiot!
I can't believe this!

You caused it by calling for your
mother and sleepwalking!

Those kids are embarrassing
us again.

The crater of Mount Asama where
an unhatched Angel lies.

Misato immediately requests the
announcement of an A-17.

NERV personnel attempt the
first capture of an Angel

under top priority circumstances.

An Eva with special equipment
challenges the fires of Hell!

It's an extreme environment
of high heat and pressure.

What did Asuka see there?

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

It's my lucky day!

I never thought you would
come shopping with me, Mr. Kaji!

Hey, now... This is the swimsuit section!

Look at this one! What do you think?

I'm not so sure. Isn't that a little
risqué for a junior high schooler?

You're so behind the times! No one
bats an eye at suits like this nowadays!

Oh. Is that the case?

This is our big school trip!
We have to cut loose and have fun!

Where are you going?

Okinawa!

The itinerary even has
scuba diving listed!

Scuba diving, huh?

It must be three years
since I last went diving.

So, where did you go for your school trip?

Oh, us? We didn't have one.

Why not?

The Second Impact had just happened.

We can't go on the school trip?!

-Nope.
-Why not?

-You have to be on standby.
-Nobody said anything about that!

-I just did.
-Who made that decision?

I did, as your operations director.

You! Stop sipping that tea
and stand up for us!

Be a man, d*** it!

Actually, I figured that something
like this would probably happen.

Meaning you had already written it off?

You're so pathetic. There's nothing
worse than a domesticated man!

Come on, don't put it like that.

I can sympathize, Asuka.

But this is out of our hands.

There might be an Angel attack
while you're away on your trip, right?

Day after day, it's always the same!
Standby, standby, standby, standby!

We're always on the defensive against
an enemy that could attack at any time!

Why don't we figure out where they are
and take the fight to them for once?!

Trust me, we would if we could.

Besides, you two should think of this
as a great opportunity.

You'll be able to focus on your studies
while your classmates are away, right?

Did you think I didn't know?

Did you really think you could
hide your test results from me?

I can easily find out every last score
you got on your tests at school.

They're so idiotic. Test scores
and grades don't mean anything!

A system that penalizes errors instead
of rewarding brains is so unenlightened!

When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

I need you to get adjusted
to school life in Japan.

Screw that!

Asuka, I'll bring you
some great souvenirs!

Aw! Tough luck, you guys!

We'll have enough fun for the both of you!

Paste a copy of the Mt. Asama
observational data

from Balthasar to Melchior
as soon as possible.

A school trip? That's a frivolous
distraction in these trying times.

They want to have fun while they can
for precisely that reason.

What are you doing?

Studying for science class.

Geez, you're such a goody two-shoes.

Make fun of me if you want,
but I need to do this.

Ta-dah!

Since I can't scuba dive in Okinawa,
I'm gonna dive right here!

Um, okay.

So, what are you reviewing?

Let me have a look.

What, you can't solve
an easy equation like this?

There, all done. It's simple!

How come you can do this tough stuff,
but you flunk our tests at school?

I couldn't figure out
what the test sheets said.

You mean you couldn't read the questions
that were written in Japanese?

Yup. I haven't learned
all of your kanji characters yet.

I didn't learn them in college back home.

-College?
-Yeah, I graduated last year.

So, what does this one say?

It's about thermal expansion.

Thermal expansion?
Wow, you're reviewing elementary stuff.

Long story short,
stuff expands when it gets hot

and shrinks when it gets cold.

Yeah, I suppose so...

I wonder if my boobs would
get bigger if I warmed them up.

Don't ask me! How should I know?

You're one seriously boring guy.

Hey, Shinji! Check this out!

Back-roll entry!

It's impossible to make anything out.

But I concur with the Mt. Asama
Earthquake Research Institute.

This shadow is troubling.

We can't dismiss it, of course.

-What was the Magi's assessment?
-Fifty-fifty, ma'am.

-Is anyone on-site?
-Capt. Katsuragi is already there.

We're at its limit!

No, give me another 500.

Depth, 1,200. Cracks appearing
in pressure bulkhead.

Ms. Katsuragi!

If it breaks, we'll reimburse you.
Give me another 200.

Sensor readings!

-Begin analysis.
-Yes, ma'am.

Probe has imploded due to pressure.

Did you finish?

Just barely. It's Pattern Blue.

Then we know for sure. It's an Angel.

This facility is hereby sequestered!
It is now under Nerv jurisdiction!

No one is allowed in or out,

and all information pertaining to
the last six hours is now top secret!

Request approval for an A-17
from Cdr. Ikari! On the double!

Be careful, ma'am.
This line is not secure.

I know that!

Hurry up and switch me over
to a secure line!

A-17?! We're going on the offensive?

Correct.

It's too dangerous. Don't pretend you've
forgotten what happened 15 years ago.

This is a golden opportunity.

We can finally take the fight to them,
rather than remain on the defensive.

The risk is too great.

This is a living Angel specimen.
I needn't stress the significance of that.

Failure will not be tolerated.

Failure? Failure would mean
the extinction of humanity.

Are you sure this is wise?

-That's an Angel?
-Yes.

It seems to be in a pupal stage,
an undeveloped state prior to maturity.

The top priority of this mission
is to capture this Angel.

You are to recover it alive,
with as little damage as possible.

And if we can't?

-Immediate destruction. Understood?
-Yes, ma'am.

-This operation's pilot will be--
-Me, me! I'll do the dive!

I'll probably get stuck
doing it again anyway.

Asuka.

-Carry out the operation in Unit 02.
-Yes, ma'am!

-This will be a piece of cake!
-What about me?

Unit 00 is a prototype, so it's
incompatible with special equipment.

Rei, you and Unit 00
will stay at HQ on standby.

Yes, ma'am.

Gee, that's too bad! You won't be able
to go to the hot springs with us!

The A-17 is already in effect,
so we need to get to work right away.

-Go suit up.
-Yes, ma'am.

This is supposed to be heat resistant,
but it doesn't seem any different.

Press the button on the right cuff.

No!

What the heck is this?!

Unit 02 is suited up, too.

No!

What is it wearing?!

Gear that protects against heat,
pressure, and radiation.

Type D configuration,
meant for localized warfare.

That's my... That's my Unit 02?

No way! I'm out!
I can't be seen in public like this!

Embarrassment is Shinji's thing,
so let him do it!

I'm sorry to hear that.

I was hoping to see you in action, Asuka.

No!

I don't have the guts to let you
see me dressed like this, Mr. Kaji!

-This is a problem.
-It certainly is.

Um, I'll--

I'll go in Unit 02.

I don't want you laying a finger
on my Unit 02! Sorry, girl!

If it means stopping the First, I'll go.

I know you look terrible,
but hang in there, okay?

Eva-01 and 02 have arrived.

Stand by for further instructions.

Expedite the laser firing
and the crane preparations.

Yes, ma'am.

Hey, where's Mr. Kaji?

That idiot won't be here.
There's nothing for him to do.

Crud, and here I was hoping
to show off in front of him.

An A-17 declaration, huh?

That allows for the freezing
of available assets.

That will ruffle the feathers
of a lot of people, I think.

Why didn't you stop them?

There was no reason to.
The order was issued legitimately.

Failure on Nerv's part will spell
the destruction of the world.

They're not that arrogant.

What are those planes?

The UN Air Force
is on standby alert above us.

Until this operation ends.

They're here to help?

-No, to clean up the mess.
-If we fail, that is.

Meaning what, exactly?

They'll incinerate the Angel using
N2 mines. And us along with it.

That's horrible!

Who would give an order like that?

Commander Ikari.

-Laser firing complete.
-Ingress route clear.

Type D gear is good to go.

Unit 02 is in launch position.

Roger that.

-Asuka, are you ready?
-Ready whenever you are.

Launch!

Wow, that looks hot!

Unit 02 about to enter magma.

Hey, check this out, Shinji!

Giant strong entry!

Depth, 170. Rate of descent, 20.

All systems show green.

Visibility, zero.
I can't make anything out.

Switching to CT monitor.

Even with this,
visibility is still only 120.

Depth, 400. Four hundred and fifty.

Five hundred. Five hundred and fifty.

Six hundred. Six hundred and fifty.

Nine hundred. Nine hundred and fifty.

One thousand. One thousand and twenty.

Exceeding design depth!

Depth, 1,300.
Now at predicted target location.

Asuka, can you see anything?

I'm not reading anything. It's not here.

The convection current must be
stronger than expected.

There's a deviation in
the target's movement speed.

Recalculate it ASAP.

Continue operation.
Resume descent, please.

Depth, 1,350. Fourteen hundred.

Cracks appearing in conduit pipe no. 2.

Depth, 1,480!

We've exceeded operating depth!

We still haven't made contact
with the target.

Keep going.

-What's your status, Asuka?
-Still good for now.

I want to wrap this up
and hit the showers!

I know a good hot spring near here.
Let's go there after we're done.

Keep at it just a little more.

Operating depth +120!

Eva-02 has lost Prog Knife.

Operating depth +200!

Ms. Katsuragi, we can't keep this up!

This isn't an unmanned probe!

I'm in command of this operation.
Please keep going.

Misato is right.
Don't worry, I'm still good to go.

Depth, 1,780. Now at revised
estimated target position.

There it is!

-We have visual confirmation of target.
-Prepare for capture.

You're both being swept along
by convection currents,

so you'll only have one shot at this.

I know. Leave it to me.

T minus 30 to target contact!

Relative speed, 2.2.
Our trajectories are matched.

Super EM photon screen engaged.
Systems green.

Target captured!

Nice one, Asuka!

Capture operation complete.
Will now begin ascent.

-Asuka, are you okay?
-Of course I am!

Like they say,
"The fear is greater than the danger."

Didn't I say this would be easy?

D***, this is more like
a sauna suit than a plug suit!

I want to jump into a hot spring so bad.

She sure got over
her case of nerves quickly.

-Oh?
-This operation also had you worried.

A little.

If we had failed, we would have had
another one on our hands.

You're right... Another Second Impact.

One was more than enough.

What's it doing?!

Oh, no! It's starting to hatch!
This is sooner than we predicted!

-What about the cage?
-It won't hold!

Abort the capture! Drop the cage!

Change operation! Top priority
is now destruction of the Angel!

Unit 02, prepare for combat
and be ready for withdrawal!

Music to my ears!

I forgot! I dropped my knife!

It's coming at me!

Releasing ballast!

It's fast!

This is bad news... I've lost the target.

Plus, visibility is bad.

It's d*** hot in here,

and my sweat is making this suit
all clingy and gross!

-Can this get any worse?
-Asuka!

Unit 01 is going to toss
its knife to you! Catch it!

Roger!

Oh, crap! Where's that knife, Shinji?!

Knife arrival in 40.

Angel closing in fast!

No! Stay away!

Hurry up, d*** it!

It's taking too long!

D*** it!

I can't believe it!
It opened its mouth down there!

Its physiology is incredible.

-Damage to left leg!
-Isolating heat intrusion!

D*** you to heck!

It's adapted to this high-heat
and high-pressure environment.

-That Prog Knife is useless.
-What can we do, then?!

-I've got it!
-That science problem!

Chew on this!

I see what she's doing! Thermal expansion!

Divert all coolant pressure
to conduit no. 3! Hurry!

No fair, I killed the thing...

This sucks. Is this the end of the line?

Shinji?

Dummy. You're really pressing your luck.

OUMIYA

Hello?

Is there anybody from Nerv here?

Coming!

COLD-SHIP PACKAGE

Sign here, please.

Here you go. Thanks!

It's from Mr. Kaji? I wonder what it is.

The bath is down the hall, on the left.

GENTLEMEN

I'm in Heaven...

I never knew a bath could feel this great.

Shinji? Can you hear me?

-Yes, ma'am?
-Could you toss us your body shampoo?

-We ran out over here!
-Sure!

-Here it comes!
-Ready!

Ow! Idiot!
Watch where you're aiming, you klutz!

Sorry.

I can't believe he hit me there!

Huh? Where?

Wow, Asuka!
Your skin is so soft and supple!

Hey, don't! I'm ticklish there!

Oh? How about here?

Hey, don't touch me there!

Oh, don't be such a baby!

I expanded down there...
Talk about embarrassing.

Oh, this? I got hurt during
the Second Impact.

You know, don't you? All about me.

Well, it's my job.

That's ancient history.
Don't let it bother you.

Cool! I won a free ice cream bar!

Laundromat
Open 24 hours

Boy, the cost of doing laundry
has been killing me lately.

I just wish I had the time to wash
my clothes for myself.

You should appreciate the fact
you can at least sleep at home.

Don't forget your ticket!

Train arriving.

Hello, Vice Commander.

Good morning, Sir.

Good morning, Sir!

Good morning.

You're quite early today.

Well, I have to go uptown as
Ikari's representative.

I see. Isn't today the City Council's
regular meeting?

It's a boring job.

He always forces the most
tedious work on me.

Without the Magi's help,
I couldn't do it.

Speaking of which, election
day is coming up, isn't it?

The City Council has
no authority at all.

Actually, the Magi run
everything now.

The Magi? You mean the three
super computers?

Government by majority decision
of three different computers.

It's a sort of democratic system.

And the council just obeys
their decisions?

It's a most effective form
of government.

This truly is a City of Science.

We are fortunate to live in an era
when Science reigns supreme.

Talk about old fashioned
viewpoints.

Come to think of it, don't you have
an experiment to run on Unit 00?

Yes, we're going to run the second
prolonged activation test at 10:30.

I'm expecting good news.

Abort experiment! Cut the circuit!

Switching circuits.

Power supply restored.

This component is the
problem again.

Yes. I think the problem is that
the conversion efficiency

is 0.008 lower than our
theoretical calculations.

It's within the tolerance
though, barely.

What are we going to do?

Let's try it again using the
same configuration,

but lower the reciprocal
conversion rate by 0.01.

Roger.

Now, let's recommence the
reactivation experiment.

Now, let's recommence the
reactivation experiment.

Episode 11:
In the Still Dark

Hey, hold up!

Man, I've never had to
run this much!

So, what's with the black
expression?

It's from seeing your loathsome
face first thing in the morning.

Yes, hold just a moment please.

What?

Well, Father...

What? Hurry up.

Well,

I'm supposed to

tell my parent that an interview

for Advanced Vocational Education
is going to be held at school.

I've delegated things like that
to Captain Katsuragi.

Don't bother me with
such nonsense.

Don't forward any more
of these calls to...

What?

A black out?
What?

A black out?

A black out?
No, it can't be. It's not possible.

No, it can't be. It's not possible.

Something's strange. An accident?

Perhaps Dr. Akagi
made a mistake?

The main power supply
has been interrupted.

Voltage level is zero!

It's not my fault.

What do you think?

It'll switch to the backup
power supply soon.

No, the backup circuits
aren't working.

That can't be.

Which circuits are functioning?

Only one point two percent!
Only nine circuits out of 2,567!

Connect all remaining live circuits
to the Magi and Central Dogma.

But that could interfere with
life support systems.

Do it! That's our top priority!

Nozomu Takahashi, wants a happier government.

Boy, she's such a lazy slob.
Nozomu Takahashi, wants a happier government.

Boy, she's such a lazy slob.
We need your support for this honest candidate.

Can't Katsuragi at least pick up her own laundry?
We need your support for this honest candidate.

Thank you!

Maybe Commander Ikari
was just really busy?

I doubt it.

It wasn't like he hung up. It was
more like a mechanical failure.

Hey, are you a man or what?

Stop letting every little
incident bother you!

What?

What do you think you're doing?
Here, let me try that!

Damn! It must be broken!

Heave...

Ho!

We'd better head for the
command station.

It's been seven minutes and the
power hasn't been restored. This...

...is very unusual.

What's the backup power
system here?

There are three circuits, main,
sub and reserve.

It's virtually impossible for all
of those to fail at once.

Then that means...

...the circuit breakers didn't
go on their own.

Someone must have blown
them intentionally.

Regardless of the cause,

it would be disastrous if an Angel
were to attack right now.

Radar has detected an
unidentified object.

Projected landing point is in
the former Atami region.

It must be number eight.

I agree, it must be an Angel.

What are we going to do?

Go to alert status. That's
the procedure, anyway.

This one's destination
has to be Tokyo-3.

I agree. Well, this is no job for us.

The Angel has landed.

It's still advancing.

What about Tokyo-3?

It's still silent.

What in the hell are those
NERV guys doing?

I never thought I'd actually have
to use one of these trap exits.

I thought they were just holdovers
kept for our peace of mind.

To provide is to prevent.

This one doesn't work either!

None of the facilities work.
This is odd.

Could this mean that something's
happened down in the Geo-Front?

It is natural to assume that.

In any case, let's try to make
contact with NERV Headquarters.

No, the emergency phones aren't
getting through either.

No, there's no answer on Line 77.

No, no response.

Not here either. So the main and
emergency cables are both down.

What do we do now?

What're you doing?

What are you, stupid? I'm looking
for my emergency manual.

Anyway, let's go to NERV
Headquarters.

Yeah, but first we'll need to
decide who will be group leader.

And naturally, I am the leader.

Any objections?

Now, let's go.

We can proceed through
Route 07, right here.

But the doors don't work.

We can open it manually.

There you go, Shinji.
That's your job.

I don't believe it! You want
to control everything,

but you always defer to
me at times like this.

Damn those Joint Staff bastards!
They always defer to us at times like this.

What does the government say?

Those Tokyo-2 buttheads?
They're getting ready to run.

The Angel is still advancing.

In any case, we must
contact NERV.

But how?

By going there yourself.

This is the 3rd District ASDF!

An unidentified object is moving
toward this area.

All residents must evacuate to
their designated shelters.

Big trouble! I've got to report
this to Headquarters!

But how?

Remember Takahashi remains
calm even in situations like this!

Please support candidate
Takahashi!

Lucky!

It's too hot.

Yeah, the air conditioners are out.

Katsuragi, if you're so hot, why
don't you take off your shirt?

There's no reason for shyness
between you and me.

Don't even think about trying to
take advantage of this situation.

Okay, okay!

It's getting even worse. Now,
the air is getting stagnant.

Hard to believe this facility represents
the most advanced technology on Earth.

But look at the Commander
and Vice Commander.

Even in this much heat, they're
cool and in command.

It's getting warmer.

Neon Genesis
Evangelion

...along with the declaration of
emergency in this district.

Emergency vehicle!
Passing through!

Oh, my! Excuse me, it's blocked!

It's okay! Charge!

This is an emergency!
Everything is permitted!

Aye, Sir!

No! Let me off!

This Geo-Front was designed to
be a self-sufficient colony,

even when isolated
from the outside.

Theoretically, it's impossible
for all of the power sources

to be shut down at once.

You mean that someone
caused it to happen?

Their purpose would be
to map this facility.

So they could determine HQ's
structure through the restoration?

Disrespectful bastards.

I'll run a dummy program
through the Magi.

That will make it harder for them
to get a complete picture.

I'll leave it to you.

Yes, Sir.
I'll leave it to you.

Yes, Sir.

I can't believe the first havoc
wreaked upon our headquarters

wasn't caused by an Angel, but by
another member of our species.

One of Mankind's greatest
enemies is Man himself.

But it usually only takes
two minutes.

Are you sure this is the right way?

Yes, I'm sure! If we can get past
this point we'll be there.

Haven't I heard that four
times already?

Picky! You always focus on the
most insubstantial little tidbits.

Silence, please.

What now, Wonder Girl?
Silence, please.

What now, Wonder Girl?

A man's voice.

Ang... proaching...

That's Hyuga!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

An Angel is approaching!
Repeat, an Angel is approaching!

An Angel?!

We can't waste any more time.
Let's take a short cut.

Hey, I'm the leader! Don't take any
initiatives without my permission!

Now then, where is this short cut?

This may be the quickest way,
but we look really stupid.

Say, just what do you think
the Angels are?

Why are you talking about that
at a time like this?

Angels are messengers of God but
our enemies are named after them.

So, why are we fighting them?

What are you, stupid? Strange
beings started attacking us.

When someone's attacking you,
you can't just sit and do nothing.

To the right!

I think the correct path is to the left.
To the right!

I think the correct path is to the left.

Stop bothering me!

What do you think, Shinji?

Well...

I'm not sure.

Damn, I'm the leader, so just
shut up, and follow me!

I expected that this would be a
little odd. The path is going up.

What do you mean, "expected?"
You always nit-pick and worry!

Look, this has got to
be it this time!

Well, we've visually confirmed
the Angel's presence.

Now, we know we have to hurry.

Angel is approaching! Immediate
Eva dispatch will be necessary!

Oh, my gosh!

Fuyutsuki, take care
of the rest of this.

Ikari?

I will help prepare for the
launch in the cage.

Are you serious?

You mean by hand?

We have a diesel generator
for such emergencies.

But...

We have no pilots!

Not again!

This way.

I've heard that you're the
Commander's favorite, aren't you?

You're a favored smart ass who's
treated differently than us.

Stop it! This isn't the time for that!

You've always got that smug
look on your face.

Do you think you can act superior
just because you're treated better?

I don't act superior.

And I'm not treated better either.

I know that quite well.

Roger. Ejection of the termination
plug is complete.

Good, prepare to insert
the entry plug.

But the pilots aren't here yet.

Don't worry, they'll come.

There's no way I can open
this with my hands.

It can't be helped. We'll have to
break into a duct to get through.

This First Child isn't someone
to mess with.

She'll do anything to accomplish
her objectives.

She's a real self-righteous bitch.

The plug is fixed and ready.

Now, we just have to
wait for the kids.

If you dare look forward,
I'll kill you!

You jerk! Ignoramus! Nincompoop!

I told you not to look!

I have to see to go forward!

Ah, there you are.

Prepare for entry!

Roger, open the hatches manually.

How are the Evas?

They're in standby.

How? Nothing's working.

It was all done by hand.

It was the Commander's idea.

My father's?

Commander Ikari believed in you
three, and prepared everything.

Plugs inserted.

All units activated using
backup power supply.

Remove primary lock bolts.

Hydraulic locks numbers 2
through 32, released.

Zero pressure.

The situation is free.

Go ahead and remove
the restraints.

Begin the attack!

The target has stopped
right above us.

Get ready! Hurry up!

The emergency batteries
have been installed!

Well, we're ready.

Launch!

Geez! I look so pathetic!

We're approaching a vertical shaft.

This is still pathetic.

Watch out! Dodge!

No!

It appears the target is going to
invade HQ using liquid solvent.

What'll we do?

We're going to beat it, of course.

Sure, but how?

We dropped our rifles, and the
battery packs are running out.

They won't last more than
another three minutes.

I have a plan.

One of us will take the defensive
position, and stay here.

Their job is to neutralize
the Angel's AT Field,

and to protect the offensive
player from that acid.

The backup player

will go down, pick up the rifles,
and hand them to the offense.

The offense will then fire a volley
to destroy the target.

How does that sound?

I see, I will take the defense.

Sorry, but it's not you.

It's me.

It's too dangerous!

That's why.

I'll feel bad if I don't repay you for
the one I owe you from last time.

Shinji will be the offense.
Wonder Girl is the backup.

Got it?

Understood.

Here we go!

CHARGE!

Ayanami!

Asuka, get out of the way!

Now, we're even.

Oh, damn it! Why doesn't it open?!

This is a desperate situation!
I've got to go to the bathroom!

Hey, I told you not to look up!

Okay! Yes, Ma'am!

Disgusting...

It's ironic.

Without electricity and artificial
light, the sky looks so beautiful.

But without the lights, it's as if
there were no humans there.

See? I feel much more
comfortable this way.

Man has always feared the Darkness, so
he scrapes away at its edges with fire.

He creates life by diminishing
the Darkness.

A philosopher!

Is that what makes Mankind
a special species?

Is that why the Angels
keep attacking us?

What are you, stupid?

Who knows what they think?

Father...

Episode 12
The Value of a Miracle is...

Thanks, Shinji, you really saved
us from that rainstorm.

Where's Misato?

I guess she must still be asleep.

She's been working all
night recently.

That's right, she has a tough job.

We've got to be quiet.
Don't wake her up.

What are you doing in here?!

Taking shelter from the rain.

You guys are after me, aren't you?

Well, I'm changing and if
you peep, I'll kill you!

Shut up, idiot!

Who would want to see you
changing clothes?!

She's way too self-conscious.

Sorry for disturbing you!

Hi, how's it going?

Shinji, don't be late tonight, we're
having a harmonics test.

Right.

Did you hear that, Asuka?

Yes, Ma'am!

Congratulations on
your promotion!

Congratulations!

Thank you.

You're most welcome.

See you later.

See you!

What's up? Did something
happen to Misato?

Didn't you see her badge?

The number of lines
increased to two.

That means that she's been
promoted from Captain to Major.

Really? I didn't notice that.

Yeah, I wonder when...

Are you serious? What a
bunch of dweebs!

Haven't you got any sympathy?

Don't you know how hard it is to
foster two jr. High kids at her age?

We're the only ones who have
some human compassion.

Units 00 and 02 are both on the
edge of the contamination zone.

They've reached their limit.

Unit 01 can still tolerate a little
more though, can't he?

Lower the graph depth
another 0.3.

He's almost reached the
contamination zone.

And he's still getting these
readings? He's wonderful.

His harmonics and sync ratio are
rapidly catching up with Asuka's.

It is a talent, isn't it?

He was born to pilot an
Eva, wasn't he?

Not that he wants to.

I know he's not happy.

Test completed. Good work.

Excellent work, Shinji.

What do you mean?

Your harmonics value increased
by eight points since the last test.

That's very good.

But still it's fifty points
lower than mine!

Yes, but he increased it by eight
points in only ten days.

That's really something.

It's not so great!

Are you happy with
your little praise?

I'm going home now! Idiot!

...and here's a message for
"Mr. Waaa" of Tokyo-2.

Having your girlfriend dump you
isn't really such a big deal.

Congratulations on your promotion.
Having your girlfriend dump you
isn't really such a big deal.

Thanks.
When I was a kid, everyone lived
in dirty huts and barely had food.

But I'm not really all that thrilled.

I understand.
We couldn't really afford to be
depressed about relationships.

I'm not happy when I get praised either.
We couldn't really afford to be
depressed about relationships.

All it does is make Asuka angry.

Congratulations!

Thanks, guys!

Thank you, Mister Suzuhara.

No, no. This wasn't my brainchild,
it was this guy right here.

That's right! I, Kensuke Aida
was the planner!

Thank you, Mister Aida.

Oh, you're welcome! But it's
not such a big deal, really.

By the way, why is the
class rep here?

Because I invited her.

Right?

Rei too?

Yes, I invited her,

but that girl is one
strange customer.

Darn, why is Mister Kaji so late?

Oh, is Mister Kaji that
really cool guy?

Oh, yeah!

He's so much better than these
dweebs that it's like night and day.

It's an insult to compare
him to them.

What did you say?!

How dare you?

Is it still difficult for you to be here

in this kind of situation?

I'm okay.

I'm just not used to being with

so many people.

Why do they have to

make so much noise like that?

Your promotion...

That means someone noticed the
work you've been doing, right?

Yeah, I suppose.

That's why they're happy.

But you don't look very
happy at all.

Oh, I'm happy. I am.

But that's not the reason
I work here.

Then why did you join NERV?

Well, I don't remember. It's been
a long time since then.

That's got to be Kaji!

I came directly from HQ. We just
happened to meet on the way.

That's rather suspicious.

Hey, are you jealous?

Absolutely not.

Anyhow, I'd like to give you my
fondest regards, Major Katsuragi.

I suppose I'll have to be polite
to you from now on.

What are you trying
to say, you jerk?

It's unprecedented for both the
Commander and Vice-Commander

to leave Japan together.

I guess they must really count
on old Katsuragi here.

My father's not here?

Commander Ikari is at the South
Pole at the moment.

Nothing living can exist in the
world of death we call Antarctica.

Or should I simply call it Hell?

Nevertheless, we,
Mankind, are here.

We're living things,
and we're alive.

That's because we're under
the protection of science.

Science is the power of Man.

That arrogance is what caused the
tragedy of fifteen years ago,

the Second Impact.

And here is the end result.

This is a greater punishment
than we deserve.

This is the real Dead Sea.

Yet this is a world that has been
purified, purged of the original sin.

I'd rather live in a world where
people can live,

no matter how stained with sin.

Report from the bridge.

Telegram received from
NERV Headquarters.

An Angel has been detected in
orbit above the Indian Ocean.

The Angel appeared suddenly,
two minutes ago.

Send Search Satellite
Number 6 to that orbit.

T-minus two minutes to contact.

The target has been sighted.

That's impressive.

I don't believe it.

Satellite Number 6 is closing
for contact with the target.

Start data search.

Data transmission commencing.

Reception confirmed.

Was that an AT Field?

It's a new way of using it.

What incredibly destructive power.

That's an AT Field!

It uses kinetic energy too.

This Angel is, itself,
like a huge bomb.

In any case, the first blast missed
its target and hit the Pacific.

Two hours later, the second
shot struck there.

Since then, it has been steadily
correcting the error ratio.

That means it's learning.

An N2 air bomb had
no effect on it.

The Angel has been missing
since then.

It's probably coming here.

Yes, and next time it
may drop itself.

So, that will give us a
third Ashinoko lake?

All five Fuji lakes will be fused into
a single body linked to the Pacific,

destroying this Headquarters
in the process.

Can we reach the Commander?

It's impossible due to the Angel's
powerful jamming.

What is the Magi's judgment?

They unanimously agree in
recommending evacuation.

What will you do?

You're the one who's in
charge of all this now.

Notify all of the ministries
concerned

of this D-17 Declaration as
provided for by NERV's authority.

All residents within radius of
50km are to evacuate immediately.

Also, ask Matsushiro to
backup the Magi.

Are we going to evacuate as well?

No, but it's not necessary to
place everyone at risk.

A D-17 Special Declaration has
been made by the government.

All residents must evacuate to
their designated locations.

Beginning with the 6th
and 7th blocks,

move according to your district
chief's direction immediately.

The evacuation of the
city is complete.

The evacuation of noncombatant
and D Class personnel

by Alarm C has been completed.

Are you serious?

Yes, I am.

You'll risk all three Evas with your
irresponsible selfishness?

The chance of success is
only 0.00001%!

That's not even one in
ten thousand!

It's not zero. I just trust the Evas.

Major Katsuragi!

I'm in charge.

I have to do what I have to do,

and destroying Angels is my duty.

Your duty? You must be kidding.

This is for your own sake, isn't it?

This is just your revenge
against the Angels!

Neon Genesis
Evangelion

Catch it in our hands?

That's right. We'll position the
Evas in the estimated drop zone.

You'll catch it while maintaining
your AT Fields at full strength.

What if the Angel doesn't come
down where you expect it to?

We'll be a little put out.

What if the Evas aren't able to
withstand the shock?

We'll be put out in that case too.

What's our probability of success?

God only knows. I have no idea.

If we succeed, it'll be a miracle.

It's not until we've done all we can to
cause a miracle that it becomes viable.

You mean, we've got to be willing
to sacrifice ourselves?

I'm sorry, but we have no other
options for this operation.

How can you call this
an operation?!

No, you can't really call it that.

You can refuse to do it,
if you wish.

So, are you okay with this?

Regulations say you're supposed
to write a will. Have you done so?

I don't need to. I'm not
going to die just yet.

Neither do I. There is no use for it.

Not me, either.

Again, I'm sorry.

But once this is over, I'll treat
you all to a steak dinner.

What? Really?

I promise.
What? Really?

I promise.

I promise.
Yeah!

Yeah!

Don't forget!
Yeah!

Don't forget!

You can count on it.

I guess she thinks a steak dinner
is supposed to impress us.

Does she really think a steak
dinner will impress us?

The Second Impact generation
has really cheap standards.

She can't help it.

What was with that fake
cheer you made?

I just wanted to make her feel
a little easier about it.

Now, since she's going to treat us,

I'd better figure out where to go.

You've got to join us this time.

No, I won't.

Why not?

I dislike meat.

Because of the Angel's ECM
jamming, we've lost track of it.

Since it's impossible to calculate
the collision point exactly,

the Magi's estimated a drop
zone based on the data

that had been collected
before it was lost.

This is it.

The range is this wide?
This is it.

The range is this wide?

The distance from one side
to the other is enormous.

Given the size of the
target's AT Field,

it could totally annihilate HQ by
hitting any of these locations.

Given that, we'll disperse the Evas
at each of these three points.

And on what grounds is
this dispersal based?

Intuition.

Intuition?
Intuition.

Yes, a woman's intuition.

How sloppy! Our miracle is getting
farther and farther away.

Misato has never won the lottery.

Say...

What?
Say...

What?

Asuka, why do you pilot an Eva?

To exhibit my talent to the
world, of course.

You mean to prove that you exist?

Yeah, more or less.

You're not going to ask her?

I've asked Ayanami before.

My, how intimate the
two of you are.

It's not like that.

Now, what about you, Shinji?

I don't know.

You don't know?
What are you, stupid?

Maybe I am.

I suppose you really are.

Twenty minutes to estimated
time of impact.

You must all evacuate now.

I can take care of this myself.

No, this is our job as well.

That's right. We can't let the kids
risk their lives by themselves.

They'll be fine.

No matter how badly the Evas
might be damaged,

their AT Fields will protect them.

Inside an Eva is the
safest place to be.

Shinji, yesterday you asked
me why I joined NERV.

My father was a man who
lived for his research,

for his dreams, to the
exclusion of all else.

I could never forgive him for that.

In fact, I even hated him.

Just like my father.

He never took care of me,
my mother or the family.

His friends always said he was
very sensitive and delicate.

But the truth was that he was
just a weak person

who didn't want to face reality,
the reality called his family.

He was like a kid.

So I agreed with my mother when
she decided to divorce him,

because she was always crying.

He was depressed about it,

but I laughed at him because
he deserved what he got.

But he sacrificed himself

to save my life during
the Second Impact.

Then, I didn't know whether
I hated him or loved him.

The only thing that
was clear to me

was I wanted to destroy the Angels
who caused the Second Impact.

So, in order to do that,
I joined NERV.

It might be that I still hate him,
and just want to avenge my father,

so that I can free myself of him.

I mustn't run away. I mustn't run
away. I mustn't run away.

Right!

I must NOT run away.

The Target has been sighted
at maximum magnification.

Distance is approximately 25,000.

Here it is.

All Evas, start your engines.

All we have is a rough estimated
trajectory from optical sightings.

So the Magi will guide you until
the distance is 10,000 meters.

After that, you'll have to use
your own judgment.

I'm placing my trust in you.

The Angel is approaching,
distance 20,000.

Commence operation.

Here we go!

Start!

Distance 12,000!

AT Field, full spread!

Unit 02! Spread your field!

I'm doing it!

Do it now!

Our wireless communications
have been restored.

We're receiving a message from
Commander Ikari in Antarctica.

Connect him here.

Yes, Ma'am.
Connect him here.

Yes, Ma'am.

I'm very sorry, Sir.

My irresponsible judgment, has
caused Unit 01 to incur damage.

It was completely my fault.

That is not a problem. Destroying
Angels is the Evas' purpose.

It was fortunate that the amount
of damage was minimal.

Excellent work, Major Katsuragi.

Thank you, Sir.

And on that subject, is the
pilot of Unit 01 there?

Yes!

I've received the report.
Good work, Shinji.

Right!

Now, Major Katsuragi, I'll leave
the rest of this in your hands.

Yes, Sir.

Next station is New Miyanoshita,
New Miyanoshita.

The exit will switch to the left
side at the next station.

Now, you're going to have
to fulfill your promise.

Of course!

I've withdrawn enough I can even
pay for a full French dinner.

Although, before payday
comes along again...

Take it easy, we know
how poor you are.

This'll be fine.

And even Wonder Girl says she'll
join us for ramen noodles.

I'll have a garlic ramen
with no roast pork.

I'll have shark-fin soup ramen
with roast pork. Large!

There you go!

Say, Misato?

What?

When I heard my father's
words today,

I think I finally understood

the good part of being
praised by someone.

And I also realized

that the reason I pilot my Eva is
to hear those words from him.

That's why you're a pilot?

You really are an idiot.

To be continued...

Preview

After a simulated plug activation

trouble occurs, and Central Dogma is invaded.

NERV is forced to accept a course of self-destruction.

Apotheosis for the three
Evas will be performed

as soon as the MAGI system
is reactivated.

Operation confirmed. Steps 450
through 670 are omitted.

Command has granted approval.

You're fast, Maya, that's
what makes you you!

Of course, I am. You trained me.

Wait a second, A-8 would
be faster there.

Let me do that.

Well, she was my teacher.

How's it going? Are you finished
giving the MAGI their check-up?

Almost done. As promised, it'll be
over before today's test begins.

You're something else, Ritsuko.

You have three impossible tasks,
yet you still beat the schedule.

That one's cold.

All three MAGI systems have
entered self-diagnostic mode.

The 127th routine maintenance
has been completed.

Confirmed. Well done, guys.

Take a break until the test begins.

Everything checked out.

As usual, mother's in
good shape, but...

Is it just me getting older?

Episode 13
Angel Invades

You want me to take off
my clothes again?

The next chamber is an ultra-clean
room environment.

Just taking a shower and changing
your undergarments is insufficient.

Why do I have to go through all
this for a simple autopilot test?

With the advance of time, Eva
technology also needs to advance.

To do so, we need a constant
influx of new data.

All right, I'm here, just
the way you wanted.

Butt-naked and run through the
wash cycle seventeen times.

Now, I want all three of
you to stay that way

as you walk through the room
and board the entry plug.

Don't worry. The video recorders
have been shut off.

We do respect your privacy.

That isn't the point! This is
a very personal thing!

This test's purpose is to remove
interference from your plug suits,

and monitor the harmonics
directly from your bodies.

Asuka, that's an order.

All right! But I don't want
anybody peeking, okay?

All pilots are ready for entry.

Start the test.

Beginning the test.
Initiate autopilot recording.

Inserting simulation plug.

Connecting simulation
bodies to the system.

The simulation plugs are now
under the MAGI's control.

Wow, that was really fast!
The MAGI are magnificent!

It's hard to believe that the first
experiment took a whole week.

According to the schedule, the
test will end in three hours.

How do you feel?

It feels odd.

Yes, it's different from
the other times.

Something's wrong
with my senses.

My right arm is all I can feel
clearly. Everything else is fuzzy.

Rei, imagine moving
your right hand.

Yes, Ma'am.

Data collection is
proceeding nicely.

Everything seems good so far.

Return the MAGI to
their normal state.

A dilemma...

You can sure feel the creator's
personality, can't you?

What are you talking about?
You created them, didn't you?

You don't know anything, do you?

That's because you never talk
about yourself like I do, Ritsuko!

That's true. I just created
the system uplinks.

The one who developed the basic
theorems and the main frame

was my mother.

Are you double checking this?

Yes, I am.

These are the parts that were
brought in three days ago.

These are the parts that are
showing signs of deterioration.

The 87th protein wall.

With magnification, you can
see some of the spots.

Can you tell me what it is?

It's got to be corrosion.
Can you tell me what it is?

It's got to be corrosion.

There are slight variations in the
temperature and conduction rates.

Deterioration of sterilized rooms
happens a lot, an awful lot lately.

The construction schedule was
cut by about sixty days.

It's possible that some air bubbles
may have gotten inside.

There are a lot of flaws in the
construction of B Wing.

This building was built after the
Angels appeared, remember?

You can't blame anyone.
Everybody was so exhausted then.

Take care of it by tomorrow.

Otherwise, Ikari will be jumping
all over our asses for it.

Understood.

Another water leak?

No, it's some kind of corrosion in
the protein wall above this floor.

Wonderful.

Could it have any effect
on this test?

No, not at the moment.

Then, let's continue.

We can't abort experiments due to
minor technical problems.

Otherwise, Commander Ikari will
be jumping all over our asses.

Understood.

Synchronization
position is correct.

Connecting the simulation plugs to
the Evas via the simulation bodies.

Contact with Eva Unit 00
has been confirmed.

AT Field will be generated on two.

What's happening?!

We've got a contamination alert
in the Sigma unit on A Floor.

The 87th protein wall is corroding
and releasing heat.

We've detected an abnormality
in the 6th pipe as well.

Corrosion of the protein wall is
increasing at an incredible rate!

Abort the experiment.
Shut off the 6th pipe.

Right!

Numbers 60, 38 and 39
are all closed.

Corrosion has occurred in 6-42.

No effect! Corrosion is spreading
along the walls.

Prepare the polysomes.

Set laser power at maximum.
Shoot the invasive particles.

Corrosion has reached 6-58.
It's here!

Rei!

Rei's simulation body is moving.

Impossible!

The corrosion is still spreading.

It's invading the simulation bodies'
active water system.

How's Rei?!

She's all right.
How's Rei?!

She's all right.
Eject all plugs immediately.

Eject all plugs immediately.

Hurry up with that laser!

An AT Field?!

Impossible!

What is it?

The pattern analysis is blue.

There's no question. It's an Angel.

An Angel?! You let an
Angel get inside?

I'm sorry, Sir.

This isn't the time for excuses.

I want a physical shut down
of Central Dogma.

Isolate it from Sigma Unit.

Initiating physical shut down
of Central Dogma.

Isolating from Sigma Unit.

Abandon this unit! Evacuate immediately!
Isolating from Sigma Unit.

Abandon this unit! Evacuate immediately!

What the hell are you
doing? Hurry!

Isolating Sigma Unit from B Floor.

Closing all partitions. All area
personnel must evacuate.

I know. Please take care of it.

Stop the alarm.

Stopping the alarm, Sir.
Stop the alarm.

Stopping the alarm, Sir.

This is a malfunction, an error
in the alarm system.

Report that to both the Japanese
government and the committee.

Yes, Sir!

The contaminated area
is still descending.

It's spreading all over Sigma
Unit from the Pribnow Box!

That's a critical area.

Yes, it's too close to Adam.
That's a critical area.

Yes, it's too close to Adam.

Stop the corrosion within
Sigma Unit!

If necessary, sacrifice the Geo
Front. What's the Evas' status?

Ready in seventh cage.

We can launch them as soon
as the pilots are recovered.

There's no need to wait for the
pilots. Launch them immediately.

Launch Unit 01 first. Sacrifice
the other two if necessary.

Unit 01 has top priority?

But Sir, we can't destroy the
Angel without the Evas.

If the Evas are contaminated first,
we'll be finished. Hurry!

Roger!

All of Central Dogma
under Sigma Unit

will be shut down in sixty seconds.

So that's the Angel.
will be shut down in sixty seconds.

So that's the Angel.
Thirty seconds until activation of vacuum pump.

Time to take a break.
Thirty seconds until activation of vacuum pump.

Central Dogma has been
completely sealed.

Mega-depth facilities are entirely
occupied by the intruder.

Well now, how will we fight off
an Angel without an Eva?

Neon Genesis
Evangelion

Look, this is the border between
the normal and heavy water.

There's a higher level
of oxygen here.

Their preference is pretty obvious.

The place where ozone
is vented in

to maintain aseptic conditions
isn't contaminated.

So does that mean that its
weakness is ozone?

It would seem so.

Injecting ozone. Ozone
concentration is increasing.

It's working, all right.

Will this work?

Zero A and Zero B seem
to be recovering.

The area around the pipes is
getting back to normal.

The central portion is proving
a little more difficult.

All right, inject more ozone.

This isn't right.

What? It's increasing?

Something is wrong. Heat
levels are increasing.

The contaminated area
is spreading again.

The ozone is no longer
having any effect.

Now it's absorbing the ozone.

Stop the ozone injection!

Amazing...

It's evolving.

What's wrong?

Something's hacking into
the sub-computer.

Something's hacking into
the sub-computer.

The intruder hasn't
been identified.

Not now! Dealing with C-mode.

Unfreeze the barrier.
Open a decoy entry.

Decoy entry has been avoided.

T-minus eighteen seconds
to completion of trace.

T-minus eighteen seconds

Spreading barrier.

Barrier has been penetrated.

No human being could do this.

Trace complete. The hacker
is inside this facility!

It's in B-Wing, in the Pribnow Box!

Optical pattern is changing.

Those glowing lines look
like electronic circuits.

This is just like a computer.

Opening decoy entry.

It failed. There's interference.

Cut off the main cable.

Negative, it refuses to
accept the command.

Fire the laser.

It's generating an AT Field.
No effect.

It's generating an AT Field.
No effect.

It is accessing the main security
bank. It's cracking the pass code.

Twelfth digit... sixteenth digit...
D word has been cleared!

It's broken into the main banks!

It's reading the main bank.
We can't stop it.

What does it want?

Scanning the main directories.

This code is... my God!

It's going after the MAGI!

Shut down I/O system.

Countdown!

Three... Two...

One!

We can't shut it down!

The Angel is intruding further
into the computers.

It's made contact with Melchior.

It's no good! The Angel is
taking over Melchior.

Melchior is being re-programmed
by the Angel.

Melchior's self-destruct
has been initiated.

Overruled. Overruled.

Melchior is hacking into Balthasar!
Overruled. Overruled.

Melchior is hacking into Balthasar!

Damn, it's too fast!

What calculation speed!

Change the logic mode.

Change synchronization code
to every fifteen seconds.

Roger!

How much time did we buy?

At least two hours, I think.

The MAGI have become
our enemy.

This Angel must be composed of
a group of micro-machines,

each the size of a virus.

These micro-machines group
together to form colonies.

In a very short period of time, they
have exponentially evolved

to form a sophisticated
intelligence circuit.

Evolved...

Yes.
Evolved...

Yes.

They're continuously
changing themselves

to form the best system to cope
with any environment.

That's their survival mechanism
as a life form.

Against an enemy that evolves to
overcome its weaknesses

the only effective counter measure
is to eliminate the host

and let the parasite die with it.

The only option is to order the
MAGI to commit suicide.

I propose the physical elimination
of the MAGI.

That's impossible.

Destroying the MAGI means
destroying headquarters itself.

Then I officially request it on
behalf of the Operations Division.

I reject it.

This is a matter for the
Technology Department.

Why are you being so
mule-headed?!

This situation is a result of
my carelessness.

Why do you always have
to be like this?

You always take the responsibility
on your own shoulders

and avoiding depending
on anyone.

As long as this Angel keeps
evolving, we have a chance.

Expedite its evolution?

Yes.

The end of evolution is
self-destruction. Death itself.

Thus, we just need to accelerate
its evolution.

If the Angel considers it the only
practical means of survival,

it may choose to co-exist
with the MAGI system.

But how?

If the Angel is a computer itself,

we can counter-hack it by
connecting Casper to the Angel

and uploading a self-destruct
program, but...

At the same time, we'll be turning
off the barrier to the Angel.

So either Casper or the Angel,
whichever is faster, will win.

Yes.

Will the program be ready in time?
Yes.

Will the program be ready in time?

If Casper is taken over first,
it'll all be over.

I keep my promises.

Red alert! Red alert!

An emergency has occurred
in NERV Headquarters.

All D-class personnel
must evacuate.

What are those?

These are notes left
by the developer.

My gosh! These are access codes!
MAGI's access codes!

It's like a special map to all of
the MAGI's back doors.

Am I allowed to see these?

I can't believe it! This is INT-C!

With these we can program much
faster than we thought!

Thank you, Mom. We can make it.

Give me the wrench.

Doesn't this remind you
of our college days?

Now, board number twenty-five.

Hey, how about telling me about
the MAGI? Just a little?

It's a long story.

A long, boring story.

Do you know about personality
transplant OS?

Yes, it's for implanting an
individual's personality

into a seventh generation
computer so it can think.

The same technology is used
for operating the Evas.

I've heard MAGI's programming
used one of the first test subjects.

My mother developed
the technology.

So, it was her personality
that was transplanted?

Right!

In a very real sense, these
brains are my mother.

Is that why you wanted
to protect the MAGI?

I don't think so. I didn't
really like my mom.

This was a decision as a scientist.

It's starting!

Balthasar is being taken over!

The self-destruct sequence has
been initiated by the computer.

Has it begun yet?!

Has it begun yet?!
Destruct will be triggered twenty
seconds after all three AI consent.

Destruct will be triggered twenty
seconds after all three AI consent.

Destruction will encompass Geoid
Depth -280, -140 and Floor 0.

Special Command 582 requires the consent...

Balthasar is now invading Casper!
Special Command 582 requires the consent...

Balthasar is now invading Casper!
...of two computers to cancel the action.

It's faster than us!
...of two computers to cancel the action.

What speed!

T-minus twenty to self-destruct.

My God!

Casper will be taken over in eighteen seconds.
My God!

Casper will be taken over in eighteen seconds.

T-minus fifteen to self-destruct.

Ritsuko, hurry!

Relax. I've got almost one whole second to spare.
T-minus ten to self-destruct.

Only one?!

Only one?!

At least it's not a zero or a minus.

Jeez, I can't get out with
no clothes on!

Somebody, help me fast!

Sigma Unit released. T-minus zero
three to MAGI reactivation.

I'm getting old. Staying up for
these all-nighters is rough.

You kept your promise again.

Good job.

Thank you.

This is the first time I've ever
really appreciated your coffee.

The night before she died,
my mother told me

that the MAGI are three
aspects of herself.

Herself as a scientist.

Herself as a mother.

Herself as a woman.

The three aspects of her struggle
for dominance inside the MAGI.

She intentionally implanted the
dilemmas of human experience.

Actually, each of the three
programs are slightly different.

I don't think I'll ever
be a mother,

and I don't really understand
her as a mother.

I respected her as a scientist.

However, as a woman, I hated her.

You're rather talkative today.

Only sometimes.

Casper contains the program
of her as a woman.

She stayed a woman to the last.
How totally like my mother.

This achievement by Shinji Ikari

She was hurt in that ruckus a while back.

It wasn't the enemy that hurt her,
it was that crazy robot!

That's stupid! How can I put up with that?

to shield Unit 01 from

No, I'm sure of it.

I'm certain for one reason: Ayanami.

I feel like Ayanami has a tenuous

grasp on her own existence.

I think she already has something
that isn't quite pessimism.

It's hard to believe she's only 14,
the same age as us.

AT THIS TIME

This is most troubling.

-It is much too soon.
-Indeed.

There was no contingency for
an Angel intrusion into Nerv HQ.

And to think it was even allowed
to enter the Central Dogma.

If contact had been made, all our plans
would have gone up in smoke.

The report made to the Council
was erroneous.

There was no Angel intrusion.

So you claim that there was no intrusion
by the Eleventh Angel, Ikari?

Correct.

Consider your words very carefully, Ikari.

False statements before this council
are punishable by death.

You are more than welcome to review
the records kept by the Magi.

You will find no evidence
of such an incident.

Don't make us laugh.
Burying the truth is what you do best!

The timeline is proceeding
as set out in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Very well. We will not deliberate
your negligence or guilt in this matter.

Just remember that there is no need
for you to write out a new scenario.

I am well aware. Everything will proceed
according to Seele's scenario.

Mountains. The heavy mountains.

Something that changes over time.

Sky. The blue sky.

Something we can't see.
Something we can see.

The sun. Something there is only one of.

Water. Something that feels nice.

Commander Ikari?

Flowers. Many of the same thing.
Many things I don't want.

Sky. The red, red sky.

The color red. I don't like red.

Flowing water. Blood.

The smell of blood.
A woman who does not bleed.

Human beings, made from red clay.

Human beings, made from man and woman.

The city. Something created by man.

Evas. Something created by man.

What is man? Something created by God?

Man is something created by man?

All I have is my life, my heart.

Entry plug, the vessel of the heart.
The seat of the soul.

Who is this? This is me.

Who am I? What am I?

What am I?

I am myself. This object is myself.

The shape that forms my self.

This is the me that can be seen.
But I sense that I am not me.

It's very strange.

I feel my body melting away.
I no longer recognize myself.

My form is fading away.
I sense someone who is not me.

Is someone there, beyond here?

Shinji?

I know this person. Major Katsuragi.

Dr. Akagi.

Everyone. My classmates. Unit 02's pilot.

Commander Ikari?

Who are you?

What are your first impressions
of Unit 01, Rei?

It smells like Shinji.

PILOT INTEROPERABILITY TEST NO. 1
SUBJECT: REI AYANAMI

Her synchronization rates are
essentially the same as in Unit 00.

Well, Unit 00 and Unit 01's
personal patterns are very similar.

That's what makes it possible
for them to synchronize.

Margin of error, plus/minus 0.03.
Harmonics are nominal.

No issues in the compatibility
of Rei with Unit 01 detected.

That concludes the test.
Rei, you can come out now.

Yes, ma'am.

UNIT SYNCHRONIZATION TEST NO. 87
SUBJECT: ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU

-Unit 02 data banks complete.
-All harmonics at normal values.

No issues with pilot.

Of course there isn't!

PILOT INTEROPERABILITY TEST NO. 1
SUBJECT: SHINJI IKARI

What's the status of
Unit 00's personal data?

Rewriting already complete.
We're currently reverifying it.

The subject?

He seems a little nervous, but his
nerve signal patterns are normal.

It's his first time in Unit 00.
It's a different Eva, so it makes sense.

What an idiot. Why can't he just do
the job without stressing out about it?

Shinji's not the kind of person
who can do that.

Yeah, I know. That's why he's an idiot.

About that interoperability test
they're doing...

Shouldn't I be tested, too?

I thought you didn't want
to pilot any other Eva, Asuka.

Well, I guess you have a point.

The fact is, Unit 02 isn't compatible
with anybody else.

Entry sequence has started.

Ionizing LCL.

Commencing primary contact.

Well, Shinji? What do you think
of Unit 00's entry plug?

It feels a little strange.

-Strange, as in uncomfortable?
-No, it's just...

It smells like Ayanami.

It smells like her?
What kind of perv talk is that?

Data received. Reverifying. Pattern green.

Main power connection complete.

All restraining gear, green.

Roger.

Let's proceed to stage two
of the interoperability test, then.

Unit 00, initiating level two contact.

Well?

As I expected, his synch rates
aren't as high as with Unit 01.

All harmonics nominal.

Still, these numbers are good.

It looks like we'll be able to put
our other plan into action.

You mean the Dummy System? With all
due respect, Senpai, that plan seems...

I understand your misgivings.

But we must always have a backup plan.

If humanity is to survive.

I have nothing but respect for you
and I'll do my job.

But I don't think this is right.

Being too principled can be painful.
It makes it hard to be around others.

That's a lesson you'll learn
the first time you feel dirty.

Initiating level three connections.

Self-psychograph stabilizing.

Like being back at
Mommy's breast, Widdle Shinji?

Or is it more like being back in the womb?

You're causing cognitive noise.
Don't bother him.

Whatever!

Geez, how come everybody around here
coddles Shinji all the time?

Initiating A10 nerve connection.

Harmonics level, +20.

What is this? I feel something
coming straight into my head...

What is it?

Ayanami... Rei Ayanami!

It's Rei Ayanami, isn't it?
That's what I'm feeling!

It's Ayanami... Or isn't it?

-What's wrong?!
-Abnormalities in pilot's nerve pulses!

-Psychological contamination setting in!
-Impossible! Not at this plug depth!

It's not from the plug! The corrosion
is coming from the Eva itself!

We've lost control of Unit 00!

Break all circuits. Shut off its power!

Eva has switched over to auxiliary power!

Unit is still active!

-Shinji's status?
-Feed is down!

I can't monitor him!

Unit 00 is rejecting Shinji?

It's not working!
Auto-eject mechanism isn't activating!

Is this a repeat of that other time?
Is it trying to absorb Shinji?!

Rei! Get back!

Unit 00 system shutdown in ten seconds!

Nine! Eight! Seven!

Six! Five! Four!

Three! Two! One!

Zero!

Unit 00 has ceased operation.

Rescue the pilot! Hurry!

Could Unit 00 have been
trying to kill Rei?

Is there a connection between
this incident and that rampage earlier?

That one with Rei?

I can't say for sure yet.

We'll have to revert its data
back to Rei's

and run a follow-up synch test
with her right away.

As Ops Director, I ask that it be done
as soon as possible.

Before it can hinder our work.

I know, Major Katsuragi.

It was me that Unit 00
was trying to hit. I'm sure of it.

Our next world-class surprise talent
is a doggie who's a taxonomist!

Wow, that's amazing!

And now, allow me to introduce Kana,
a truly gifted doggy from Niigata!

Let me ask the question first!
Can you understand us?

-Woof!
-Wow, really?

So let's get right to it
and have you answer a question!

Woof!

What's the common name for the animal
with the scientific name of Canis lupus?

Woof!

Gosh, "wolf" is right!
You're a bona fide scientist!

I hate this. It's this same
stupid ceiling again...

Shinji's regained consciousness.
No contamination aftereffects.

He says that he doesn't remember anything.

I see.

I'm fine, but there was another terrorist
attack over the Spratly Islands.

Misato and Mr. Kaji
won't tell me anything.

And Shinji is clueless about everything.

The First... What kind of girl is she?

An unpredicted Angel intrusion...

The Council found out about it,
and they're using it to pressure us?

What a worthless bunch.
Their one job is to complain.

We hold all the cards.
There is nothing that they can do.

Perhaps, but that doesn't mean
you should antagonize them.

Things would get complicated
if Seele got involved now.

In various ways.

Everything is proceeding according
to our scenario. It's not a concern.

What about that accident with Unit 00?
That certainly wasn't in my scenario.

It affects nothing.

The re-synchronization of Rei
to Unit 00 was successful.

You're too fixated on Rei, Ikari.

What about Project Adam?

Proceeding smoothly.
We're not even 2% behind schedule.

And the Spear of Longinus?

Also on track.
Rei is carrying out the operation.

It's me.

Oh, it's you.

Shanon Bio...
it's a foreign chemical company.

It was established here 9 years ago,
and it hasn't changed in 9 years.

106 out of 108 companies connected to the Marduk Agency are dummies.

And that's the 107th,
isn't it ?

This is the registration
of the company.

You're gonna say, ``Look at the names of the executive officers,'' right ?

So, you knew.

I already know
those names.

The Marduk Agency, which was established to choose the pilots for Evangelion...

...is an advisory organization under the Human Complement Committee's direct control.

Details of the organization
are still unknown.

Your duty is to investigate NERV. It's not advisable to meddle with the Organization.

Well, I won't be satisfied unless
I confirm everything myself.

Hello, this is Kaji. I'm out now.
Please leave a message if you need to.

Help me, Kaji !
What're you doing, you pervert ?!

That should do it.

What happened ?

Tomorrow's Sunday, and I wanted Kaji to take me somewhere, so I called him...

...but he's not there.

He's been out every time
I've called him these days.

That means you're
free tomorrow, right ?

Unfortunately, yes.

I want to ask
you a little favor.

Actually...

Date...?!

He's my sister Kodama's friend.
I was asked to introduce you.

I beg you.

Yo !

Do it seriously !

Sorry.

Cleaning is what you
should do seriously !

Necrosis procedure is over.

The reversible graph,
measuring complete.

What are you going
to wear tomorrow ?

For the wedding reception...?

I wore a pink suit
at Kiyomi's reception.

I just wore the deep
blue dress at Kotoko's.

What about the orange one ?
You haven't worn it for a while.

Oh, that one...?
I can't wear it for some reason...

Too tight ?

Damn right.

I'd better
buy a new one.

I've had to
spend a lot recently.

Lately, it's been happening one after another. The cost of gifts isn't going down either.

They must've rushed it
since they're almost thirty.

Neither you nor I want to be the last ones, do we ?

All three of you
can come back now.

Good work.

I'm tired of tests.

Come to think of it, Shinji looked depressed more than usual today.

Because ``it'' is tomorrow.

That's right,
``it'' is tomorrow.

I have to see
my father tomorrow.

What do you think
I should talk about ?

Why are you asking me ?

Because I've seen you
talking cheerfully to my father.

Can you tell me...what kind
of person is my father ?

I don't know.

I see.

Is that why you've been
staring at me, to ask that ?

At cleaning time you were wringing the dust cloth, weren't you ?

You looked motherly.

Mother ?

It looked like it was a
mother's way of wringing.

Actually, you may be suited
to being a housewife.

What are you
talking about ?

I'm home !

Welcome back.

Get to bed. You have a date tomorrow, don't you ?

Yeah, with a
``handsome'' guy.

Oh, that's right.
Can I use your lavender perfume ?

No.

You're stingy.

It's not for children.
Is Shinji in his room ?

He hasn't come out at all. He doesn't seem to want to see his father.

If he doesn't want to, why doesn't he say so ? Japanese are always...

It doesn't mean that he doesn't want to. And that's the problem.

Go home.

Good job, Shinji.

Shinji...

...I'm coming in.

Are you afraid of
seeing your father alone ?

You shouldn't
keep running away...

...but you have to step forward
or nothing'll change.

I know.

You'll discover the importance of going forward once you've taken the first step.

Anyway, be confident tomorrow.
You're going to see your mother as well.

Well, good night.

You bought a dress for tomorrow, right ?
Let me see it ?

You wanna see it ?
It was expensive.

Your sense is more
important than the price.

It's great.

Did you pick one
that Kaji would like ?

Well, I don't now.

The next day.

Well...

...we're...

...going.

Three bags in your heart...

Red, blue and yellow...

Well then, please take
some time to talk freely.

Ryo-chan hasn't showed up.

That idiot never
shows up on time.

For dating, right ?
He does when he's working.

Oh, you two are as
beautiful as ever.

I couldn't finish
my job in time.

Despite that, you're
always killing time ?

Besides, why're
you always unshaven ?

Hey, your tie's loose.

Oh, thanks.

You guys look like
a married couple.

I'm pleased to
hear that, Rit-chan.

Why would we be...?

It's been three years
since we visited here.

I ran away back then,
and I haven't come back until now.

I don't feel like
my mother's in there.

I don't remember
her face either.

People live by
forgetting the past.

But there are things
you shouldn't forget.

Yui taught me
that important fact.

I come here
to reaffirm that.

Don't you have any photos ?

No. This tombstone's ornamental.
There was no body.

You threw everything away, just like my teacher said, didn't you ?

Everything's inside my heart.
That's enough for now.

It's time.
I'm going back.

Father...

...well, I'm glad that
I could talk to you today.

I see.

NEON GENESIS

Not bad at all. I didn't know you could do stuff like that.

I can only play this well because I started when I was five...

...I don't have
much talent.

Don't they say, ``persistence is a virtue ?''
I have a better impression of you now.

I started playing because
my teacher suggested it.

I could have
given it up.

Then, why'd you
keep playing ?

Because no one
told me to stop.

I thought so.

You're home early. I thought
you were going to eat supper.

He was boring, so I left him while we were waiting for the roller coaster.

That's pretty rude.

Kaji's the only nice guy.

What're you talking about ?
I'm going to the bathroom.

Don't disappear.

High-heels...?

When was the last
time we drank together ?

Misato's been drinking too much.
She seems happy for some reason.

Drink to hide your cheerful self...
Today, I might be like that.

The person who lived with her
says something convincing.

We lived together, but that's before she put on high-heels.

We couldn't imagine that
when we were in school.

I was young, and we were simply staying in the same place. It was like playing house.

The reality isn't so sweet.

Oh, this is
for your cat.

Thanks.
You're so nice.

Only to women.
My work's sloppy.

I wonder.
To Misato, also ?

I bought a farm once. I won't join a losing war. That's my policy.

I think you have
a winning strategy.

What about you, Rit-chan ?

I have a policy not to talk about myself,
because it's not very interesting.

She's late. I wonder if
she's touching up her makeup.

Why did you
go to Kyoto ?

Hey, that's
from Matsushiro.

Don't play innocent. If you go too far, your fingers will get burned.

I'm giving you a warning,
as a friend.

I'll listen. It's okay if I get burned while I'm playing with you...

Should I buy you
some fireworks ?

Oh, welcome back.

Your fickle personality
hasn't changed at all.

Yes, it has.
To live is to change.

That's homeostasis
and transistasis.

What's that ?

The forces to maintain or
change the current situation.

We have both of those conflicting characteristics at the same time.

Like a man and woman.

I'd better go home.
I still have work to do.

Really ?

Too bad.

Bye.

Shin-chan...?
It's me.

I'm drinking with Kaji.
Yes, we're holding a third party.

Okay...okay...bye.

Misato ?

Yeah. She said she'll be late
and to go to bed.

She's not coming home
tomorrow morning, is she ?

She can't be because
Kaji's with her.

Are you stupid ?!
That's why I asked.

Grownups usually don't puke.

Sorry about being
old already.

We're the same age.

That's right.

You're wearing high-heels.
I really feel like time has passed.

Why don't you shave ?

Okay, okay.

I'll walk. Thanks.

Kaji, have I changed ?

You've become more beautiful.

I'm sorry that I said
goodbye back then.

I told you I fell in love with another guy, but it was a lie. Did you know that ?

No.

I noticed that
you were like my father.

I was longing for
my father in men.

When I noticed that,
I was scared, so scared.

Staying with you, being a woman.
Everything was scary.

I hated my father, but I fell in love with a man like him.

I joined NERV
to forget everything.

But it's the organization my father once belonged to.

I was deceiving myself by
taking revenge against Angels.

You've chosen to do that.
You don't have to apologize to me.

No, I didn't choose !
I was simply running away.

I ran away from the
chains called ``father.''

It's just like Shinji.

I'm a coward.

I'm really sorry to say such things,
though it's because I'm drunk.

That's enough.

I'm so childish. I have no
right to preach to Shinji.

That's enough.

I'm hypocritical because I rely on a man at my convenience, just like now !

I might have used you back then !
I hate it !

That's enough. Stop.

I'm so disappointed
in myself !

Hey Shinji,
do you want to kiss ?

What ?

Kiss, you know, a kiss.
You haven't kissed, right ?

Then, let's do it.

Why ?

Because it's boring.

``Boring,'' you said...?

You don't want to kiss on the anniversary of your mom's death, do you ?

Do you think she might
be watching us from Heaven ?

No.

Are you scared ?

No, I'm not
scared of kissing.

You brushed your teeth,
didn't you ?

Then, here I come.

Don't breathe through
your nose, it tickles.

Yuck ! I shouldn't have done it
to kill time after all !

Hey, we're home.
Hang on.

Kaji.

Kaji !

Well, I'm going home.

Why don't you stay ?

They'll laugh at me if
I go to work looking like this.

It's okay.

Right, Kaji ?

See ya.

The smell of lavender...

You two, take care
of Katsuragi, okay ?

Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

What's wrong ?
You look disappointed.

It's because I kissed you !

Well, girls are next.

Next day.

Ayanami...

Is Ayanami absent today, too ?

NERV Headquarters

The center of the deep
underground facilities.

Central Dogma

Same location.
2008 meters under ground.

Terminal Dogma

How's your hangover ?

It's gone, thanks to you.

That's good.

Is this your true job ?
Or just part time ?

I don't know.

Kaji Ryouji belongs to the Special Inspection Division of the Special Institute, NERV...

...but you also belong to Japan's Ministry of the Interior, don't you ?

You knew, huh ?

Don't underestimate NERV.

Did Commander Ikari order you ?

No, this's my own act.

If you continue your part time job any further, you'll die.

Commander Ikari's making use of me.
I'll continue for a while.

But I apologize to you
for keeping this a secret.

I'll cancel this to show
my thanks for last night.

Thanks. But the Commander, and even Rit-chan, kept this a secret from you.

This is it.

That's...

Eva...

No...it can't be.

Yes, it's the key to
everything since the Second Impact...

...and it was the
beginning as well.

It's Adam.

Adam...?
The First Angel is here...?!

Surely, NERV can't
be taken lightly.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

Hm? Shinji, are you using
a different soup stock?

Yes, that's bonito stock.
It was a present from Ms. Ritsuko.

That's too hot!

Sorry.

You always apologize instantly!
Do you really even feel sorry?!

It's like a conditioned response with you!
You do it so people won't yell at you!

-Sorry.
-See?!

You're too intropunitive! Fundamentally!

Come on now.
That's just the way Shinji is.

And you! You're too quick
to put up with his crap!

Don't you think you've been
too soft on Shinji lately?!

Really?

Just because you got back
together with Mr. Kaji,

don't try to push your happy-happy
vibe onto the rest of us!

There's nothing going on
between Kaji and me.

Hey, Katsuragi! I found a bar with
great booze. You free tonight? Later.

But what do I know? I've never been
in a sleazy adult relationship.

But here you are, acting like a paragon
of virtue! What a hypocrite!

You make me want to puke!

Type-B harmonics test, results normal.

Adjusted depth values have all been met.

You look kind of tired, Ms. Misato.

I have a lot on my plate. Personal stuff.

-Involving Ryoji?
-Don't go there!

So, how's the Third Children doing?

-Take a look at this.
-At what?

I hope this gives him a confidence boost.

Do you read me, Shinji?

How did I do on the test, Ms. Misato?

Congrats! You are number one!

Well, this stinks. He blew right past me.

He did it so effortlessly
it's a little frustrating, you know?

He's amazing! Magnificent!
Tough! Too tough!

Ooh, Shinji the Mighty!

Our jobs will be so much easier
thanks to him!

Right?

We'll have to work super-duper hard
to keep him from leaving us in the dust!

Farewell.

TOKYO-3, YUMOTO STATION

The next stop is Seisho-Kanose.
Seisho-Kanose.

The stop is next to Bashar,
the used book and video store.

Yeah!

Evacuation of Nishi ward
will take five more minutes!

Target advancing slowly.
Rate of speed, 2.5 kph.

What kept you?

Sorry! What happened? No report from
the Mt. Fuji radio observation post?

It wasn't on their scopes! It appeared
out of nowhere right on top of us!

Pattern Orange! No A.T. Field detected!

-What's that mean?
-Is it a new type of Angel?

The Magi are reserving judgment.

D*** it, what a time for
Commander Ikari to be away...

Do you all read me?

As you can see in the data we sent,

we don't have a lot to go on.

Approach the target carefully
and see how it responds.

If possible, lure it outside the city.

One of you will take point,
with the rest providing cover. Got it?

Ooh! Ms. Katsuragi! I think Shinji
is the best man to take point!

This is obviously a job for the man's man
who has the best grades, is the bravest,

and who has the number one
synchro rate, right?

Or don't you think you can do it, Shinji?

I can handle it!

I'll show you how it's done, Asuka!

What did you say to me?!

Cool your jets, kids.

You're the one who said it, Ms. Misato.
I'm number one.

Um, that was--

Fighting is a man's job!

That's so antiquated!

Unit 02, providing cover!

Unit 00, also providing cover.

Those kids just completely ignored me.

Shinji's really come around,
don't you think?

Not like this. He needs a good
talking-to when he gets back.

You know, you have the makings
of a fine foster mother.

STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EFFECT:
CLOSED TO GENERAL VEHICLES

-Ayanami, Asuka, are you in position?
-Not yet.

We can't cover that much
ground that quickly!

Where are they?

I guess I should pin down this Angel.

It disappeared!

What is it?

Pattern Blue! Angel detected!
It's right below Unit 01!

Its shadow!

What is this thing? This makes no sense!

Shinji, get out of there! Shinji!

-Shinji!
-What are you doing, you idiot?!

Ms. Misato! What's happening?! Ms. Misato!

Asuka! Ayanami! I need backup!

Ms. Misato, do you read me?!

Eject entry plug! Send the signal!

Negative! There's no response!

Ms. Misato! Ms. Misato!

Shinji!

Asuka! Rei! Rescue Unit 01, hurry!

That idiot! Perfect scores on mock tests
don't mean a thing out here!

-It vanished again!
-Asuka, be careful!

A shadow!

Oh, no!

The city, it's...

Asuka, Rei, fall back.

-Wai--
-Wait!

Unit 01 and Shinji are still in there.

That's an order. Fall back.

This must be hard on Major Katsuragi.

When they reeled in the umbilical cable,

nothing was attached to the end.

But that means...

There's not much left
in his Eva's internal batteries,

but if Shinji can refrain from moving
around and stay in life-support mode,

he can stay alive for 16 hours.

Second tank platoon in position.

Roger. Hold position and stand by.

Opening sub laser comm line. Send specs.

Link confirmed.
Transmitting over C channel.

-UN Forces have set up a perimeter.
-And the shadow?

No movement. It grew to just past
600 meters in diameter and stopped.

How are ground forces going to be
any use against that, though?

They're here as a show of strength.
Directed at us.

What a mess. He rushed in by himself
and ignored the plan.

He has no one to blame but himself.

Just because the idiot did okay
on that test yesterday,

he goes, "I'll show you how it's done!"

He got too big for his britches!

What, you don't like it when
people bad-mouth Shinji?

Do you pilot your Eva
to be praised by others?

No, not by others! I pilot it
because I want to praise myself!

That's enough, you two.

It's true, he rushed in
without permission.

That's why I have to chew him out
when he gets back.

I never thought that sleeping
could be so exhausting.

Nothing but white.

No radar or sonar returns...
This void is too big.

It's been 12 hours since
I switched to life-support mode.

I guess I only have
four or five hours to live.

I'm hungry...

You're saying that the shadow
is the Angel's actual body?

Yes. It's roughly 680 meters in diameter
and three nanometers thick.

It's supporting that super-thin space
with an inverted A.T. Field.

The interior is an imaginary numbers space
known as the Dirac sea.

It may be connected to another universe.

And the sphere?

It vanishes when the body's
imaginary numbers circuit closes.

That object floating up there
is in reality just a shadow.

So our target is the black shadow
that swallowed Unit 01.

Then there's nothing we can do about it!

The water is getting murky!

The filters are starting to fail!

It smells...

Blood! It smells like blood!

No! Let me out!

Why won't the hatch unlock?!

Open up! Let me out of here!

Ms. Misato, what's going on?! Ms. Misato!

Asuka! Ayanami!

Ms. Ritsuko!

Father...

Please... Somebody help me.

Salvage the Eva with brute force?

As things stand,
it's the only viable option.

We drop our remaining stock of
992 N2 mines on its core area.

Concurrently with this,
our other two Evas use their A.T. Fields

to disrupt the Angel's imaginary numbers
circuit for one millisecond.

At that instant,
we focus the explosive energy

to destroy the Angel,
along with the Dirac sea that forms it.

But the Eva's frame can't take...
What will happen to Shinji?!

What kind of rescue op is this?!

The top priority of this operation
is the recovery of Unit 01.

Regardless of how badly damaged
the body may become.

Now, wait just a minute!

In these circumstances,
the pilot is expendable.

It was your mistake that cost us Shinji.
Don't you dare forget that.

Why are you and Commander Ikari
so fixated on Unit 01?

What the heck are the Evas?!

The files we gave you
are everything we have.

You liar.

Misato, please trust me.

I am taking command of
all aspects of this operation.

Route air traffic to Kansai International.

Contact the ACC and the JASSDF's
Strategic Airlift Command.

The Second Impact...
The Instrumentality Project... Adam...

I'm in the dark about way too many things.

Who is it?

Who's there?

Shinji Ikari.

But that's me.

I am you.

People have another self inside them.

The self always consists of two selves.

Two?

The self that is seen by others,
and the self that observes that act.

There are even multiples of
the individual named Shinji Ikari:

The other Shinji Ikari
that's in your own heart.

The Shinji in Misato Katsuragi's heart.
The Shinji in Asuka Soryu's heart.

The Shinji in Rei Ayanami's heart.
The Shinji in Gendoh Ikari's heart.

Each is a different Shinji Ikari,
and yet they're all the real Shinji Ikari.

You're afraid of the Shinji Ikaris
that are inside others.

I'm afraid of being hated by others.

No, you're afraid of being hurt.

Whose fault is that?

It's Father's fault.

The father who abandoned me.

It's my own fault.

There you go again,
instantly assuming that you're to blame!

That's what they call intropunitive!

I'm the one that can't do anything right!

You're the one that thinks
that he can't do anything right.

Don't you have faith in your own father?

I think I hate him.
But I'm not sure anymore.

Good work, Shinji.

Father called me by name!

My father, of all people,
actually praised me!

You're going to keep nursing that tiny bit
of happiness for the rest of your life.

If I believe in those words,
I can go on living.

By deluding yourself?

Everybody does it!
Everybody does that to go on living!

Believe in yourself for who you are.
Otherwise, you won't be able to go on.

The world is full of too many
painful things for me to live in it.

Like not being able to swim?

People aren't designed
to be able to float!

-That's self-deception.
-Call it whatever you want!

You've spent your life ignoring
or avoiding anything you don't like.

In that last battle, his kid sister got...

It doesn't matter
what everybody else thinks!

Get out!

No! I don't want to hear this!

See? You're running away again.

People can't handpick a series
of pleasant events to make up their lives.

Especially not me.

I found something that I enjoy doing.

Finding something you like
and doing just that one thing...

What's wrong with that?!

The entry plug's reserve power
is almost at its theoretical limit.

His plug suit's life-support system
is also entering the danger zone.

Let's move up the schedule by 12 minutes.

While there's still a chance
that Shinji is alive.

Father... am I an unwanted child?

Father!

You're the one who chose to run away.

That's right! The man's suspected
of killing his wife!

He killed his own wife!

No! Mother was... She was smiling.

You did a fine thing today
that people will praise you for.

You shouldn't run away, Shinji.

Keep it up.

I don't like it here.
I'm tired of being...

alone.

The heater and oxygen circulation
have both stopped...

I'm so cold...

It's hopeless... My suit's about had it.

I guess this is it. I'm so tired...

Tired of everything.

Mother?

You'll be okay?

Oh? I'm glad to hear it.

-Both Evas are in position.
-A.T. Field preparations complete.

-Roger.
-T minus 60 to mine drop.

What's happening to it?!

-Give me a sit-rep!
-Unknown, ma'am!

All the meters are off the scale!

But we didn't do anything!

-Wait, could it be Shinji?!
-That's not possible!

Unit 01's energy is down to zero!

I'm... piloting one of those things?

What have we...
What kind of monster did we copy?

I know d*** well that the Evas aren't
simple copies of the 1st Angel.

But what is Nerv planning to do with
the Evas after the Angels are defeated?

Shinji!

Shinji! Are you okay, Shinji?!

I just wanted to see everybody.
One more time.

Weren't you going to chew him out?

I've never felt more afraid
of the Evas than I did today.

Are they really on our side?

It's possible that they hate us.

Major Katsuragi might suspect something.

I see. That’s fine for now.

If Rei and Shinji ever learn
the secret of the Evas,

they'll probably never forgive us.

You can stay in bed today.
We’ll take care of the rest.

Thanks, but I'm okay now.

Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

It's still there. The smell of blood.

Are you refusing to allow us to
question the pilot of Unit 01,

the only one directly involved in
the incident, Major Katsuragi?

Yes, Sir. Because he is
emotionally very unstable,

I believe that it would be unwise
to have him here.

Then, as his proxy, let us ask you,
Major Katsuragi.

In this incident,

didn't the Angel attempt to
communicate with a human being?

I find no suggestion of that
in the subject's report.

I believe this was an irregularity,
a coincidence.

If, and only if, his memory
is correct.

There is no evidence that his
memory has been tampered with.

However, the Eva's AC recorder
was not functioning.

There's no way to confirm it.

Was the Angel interested in the
human spirit? In the human mind?

I am unable to answer
that question.

Whether the Angels even have
a concept of what "Mind" is,

or whether they can understand
human thoughts or not

is completely unknown.

A new factor has been added
with this incident,

in that the Angel tried to
take Eva into itself.

Is there any possibility that this
aspect may be linked

to the predicted Thirteenth Angel
and all Angels thereafter?

Based on the previous patterns,

there appears to be no systematic
organization among the Angels.

Correct! It is obvious that they
have worked independently, so far.

What do you mean, Sir?

You are not allowed to
ask questions.

Understood.

That will be all. Dismissed.
Understood.

That will be all. Dismissed.

Yes, Sir.

What do you think, Ikari?

The Angels appear to be getting
more and more intelligent.

There's not much time left.

Episode 17
The Fourth Child

Left for us, you mean?

Who's the patient in Room 12?

That's the emergency room patient
from the first Eva incident.

She's been here for a long time.

Her injuries are really difficult,
poor girl.

She's still in elementary school.

He's here again today?

Yeah, he comes to see her
at least twice a week.

He's a good brother, thinking
about his sister like that.

Yeah, boys like that
are pretty rare.

He has a good heart.

Rei, are you all right today?

Yes, Sir. I will be with
Dr. Akagi tomorrow,

and the day after
I'll be at school.

How is the school?

No problems, Sir.

I see. That's good.

Stand up! Bow! Sit down!

Let me see, Ayanami is absent
as usual, and Aida too?

What's up with Kensuke?

What's up with Kensuke?
Professor Koike is absent today,

He went to New Yokosuka to see a battleship.
Professor Koike is absent today,

He went to New Yokosuka to see a battleship.
So the class in modern Japanese will be self-study.

A ship called Myoko or something is in port.
So the class in modern Japanese will be self-study.

A ship called Myoko or something is in port.
And finally, the student on duty today will be...

Mister Suzuhara.

Yes, Sir!
Mister Suzuhara.

Yes, Sir!

Will you deliver this document to
Miss Ayanami after school?

Yes, Sir!

Don't worry about it.
First Branch is okay.

The data from the recon plane will
be confirmed by the MAGI.

It disappeared?!

The entire Second Branch
just vanished?!

Yes, Sir, it's been confirmed.

It's gone.

Dear God...

Administration and Investigation
sections are going crazy,

and General Affairs
is in a total panic.

What was the cause?

It's still under investigation.

Our only clues are these
geo-synchronous satellite photos.

There's nothing else left.

This is horrible.

Evangelion Unit 04,

its support group and all other
facilities within an 89km radius

were completely destroyed.

Along with thousands of people.

Looking at the time schedule,

It seems they were installing the
experimental S2 engine.

Potential causes range from

a lack of structural integrity to a
preliminary design stage error.

That's 32,768 possibilities
right there.

And that's not mentioning
sabotage.

But it wasn't an explosion, was it?

It was a disappearance.

In all probability, they were
swallowed by a Sea of Dirac,

just like Unit 01 was.

And the restored S2 engine?

Gone, along with our hopes.

It's all because we're being forced
to use things we don't understand.

Things like the Evas.

What'll we do with Unit 03?

We'll receive it here.

The U.S. Government doesn't want
to lose the First Branch as well.

Didn't they insist on the right to
build Units 03 and 04?

And now they're foisting
it off on us?

They're really pushing their luck.

After a disaster like that, anyone
would get nervous.

And how are you going to
do the test activation?

Will you use Rei's dummy plug?

I'll have to make a decision.

This is the dummy plug prototype.

Rei's personal data has
been loaded into it,

but it's not really possible to
digitize a human mind and soul.

A fake, that's all it is.

It copies a pilot's thinking
process.

In the end, it's only a machine.

It transmits a signal
pattern to Eva,

and Eva believes there's a pilot
and synchronizes. That's enough.

Load the data into Unit 01
and Unit 02.

There are still some
problems with it.

That's not important. As long as
the Eva activates, it's sufficient.

Understood.

I've delegated the transportation
of the Unit to the U.N.

It will arrive by the end
of the weekend.

You'll take care of it from there.

Yes, Sir.

We'll perform the modifications
and activation test in Matsushiro.

And the test pilot will be...

Use of the Dummy Plug is not
recommended at this time.

One of our prospective
candidates...

Will be chosen as the
Fourth Child?

Yes, there is one child whose core
can be prepared immediately.

Then, I'll trust you to make it so.

Yes, Sir.

Rei, we're finished now.

Yes, Sir.

Let's eat.

Yes, Sir.

Stand up! Bow!

Lunch time! Lunch time! This is
the single best thing about school.

You didn't make lunches for us?

I didn't have time to cook last
night. I had too much homework.

And that's your excuse for me
having to go without lunch?!

A husband and wife quarrel?

It's not like that!

What is it? You look so serious.

It's the Unit 03 activation test.

We'll be using the Fourth
as the pilot.

The Fourth?

The Fourth Child's been found?

Just yesterday.

But I haven't received a report
from the Marduk Institute yet.

The official documents will be
delivered tomorrow.

Dr. Akagi, are you hiding
something from me again?

No, nothing at all.

Well, okay. So, who's the kid?

Jeez! It's HIM?!

It can't be helped.

All the possible candidates were
gathered together for protection.

It's so hard to tell them.

Asuka will be fine. Her pride
keeps her piloting her Eva.

Rei is exceptional,

with no problems with her
Eva or our work.

Shinji probably knows the most
about the down side.

I don't want him to suffer
any more hardships.

But we need children of this kind,

in order for us all to survive.

Are you saying not to
complicate the issue?

Bye! Later!

Suzuhara, you've got the duty
this week. Get to work!

What do you mean?

The class printout!

Didn't our teacher tell
you to deliver this?

Come on, you can ask the other
person on duty, can't you?

Miss Ayanami is absent today!

Ayanami and me?

Then I guess there's no choice.

But I don't want to go to some
girl's place all by myself.

Well, I can go with you...

Shinji!

Walk home with me, will you?

Ayanami, we're coming in.

You can't enter a girl's room
without her permission.

We've got no choice.

She won't see it if we
leave it there.

Excuse us...

Good grief!

Is this a girl's room?
It's so decrepit.

Hey, you shouldn't touch anything!
She'll get pissed!

I'm just cleaning up.

I won't help you!

That's not a man's job!

Okay, but Misato hates
guys like that.

I don't care! It's my policy!

Come to think of it,
you've changed.

What?

You, Shinji.

The first time I saw you, I really
thought you were a jerk.

You didn't seem like you would do
something for someone else.

I guess you're just
really reserved.

Excuse us!

What?

What?
Those are the school bulletins that have piled up.

Those are the school bulletins that have piled up.

I'm sorry.

I took it upon myself
to clean up a little.

But I didn't touch anything
except trash.

Thank you.

Eva pilots are sure
weird all right.

Thank you...

Words of gratitude.

Words I've never used.

Not even to him.

The city, a paradise
made by Mankind.

Driven from Paradise,

Man escaped to this earthly
existence, on the edge of Death.

Created by the weakest of beings,

created by the sapience born
from that weakness,

this paradise is our creation.

To protect ourselves from
the fear Death instills,

to satiate our beings
with pleasure,

we create a paradise by
and of ourselves.

This city's surely such a paradise.
A city armed to protect us.

A city of refugees from the outer
world, the world of our enemies.

But cowards do live longer.

That's to our benefit.

The third New Tokyo, NERV's
hidden intercept base,

the delayed seventh construction
phase will be finished soon.

At long last, it will be completed.

How will you report Unit 04's
"accident" to the committee?

With the facts, the cause
is unknown.

But this is a major,
catastrophic loss.

Unit 04 and the Second Branch
are of no consequence.

The S2 engine prototype
may have been lost,

but the data is still on
record in Germany.

This installation and Unit 01
will be sufficient.

But the committee is in a panic.

Of course, it was an
unscheduled accident.

Seele must be busy changing
the schedule.

Incidents not depicted in the
Dead Sea Scrolls may occur.

This ought to teach those
old men a lesson.

The Third District Transformation
and Direction Weapon experiment

is on schedule.

The intercept system is completed,
is on schedule.

The intercept system is completed,
Will Dr. Nishizono of the Technical Department,

and they're not going to have a party?

NERV is a most inflexible organization.
Call Section 2 of the R&D Division immediately.

NERV is a most inflexible organization.

It's because of Commander Ikari.

And are you a prude too?

Are you serious, Mr. Kaji?

I'll tell Ms. Katsuragi
and Dr. Akagi.

Not if your mouth is covered
with mine.

So, how's it going?

Well, it's going, I guess.

Well, I have work to do.
Excuse me.

Far be it from me to make
judgments on your private life,

but should you really be hitting
on girls in this organization?

Who's under whom isn't
your concern.

Or would you prefer I hit
on you, Katsuragi?

It depends on how you
answer my questions.

You know the secrets of the
Marduk Institute and Adam, right?

What secrets?

Don't try to feign ignorance!

Asking for help isn't like you.

You know, right now I don't care.
I'm not feeling very reserved.

The Fourth Child was conveniently
found at just the right time.

What's the truth behind that?

I'll tell you one thing.

The Marduk Institute doesn't exist.

NERV is pulling the strings
all by itself.

NERV itself?

Commander Ikari is?

You need to check Code 707.

Code 707?

Shinji's school?

Misato!

What is it?

Ritsuko's expecting you for a
meeting about tomorrow's trip.

All right. Thank you.

See you.

Yeah, yeah.

Buy you a drink? Cup of tea?

But I'm a boy.

I thought you'd be a more
serious person, Kaji.

You're saying that to someone as
straight arrow and reliable as me?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry too. I didn't mean
to sound rude.

Hey, I want to show
you something.

They're watermelons?

Yeah, aren't they cute?
This is my hobby.

Keep it a secret, okay?

Growing... Making something
grow is really great.

One can see and learn so many
things from the process.

It also brings pleasure.

But pain too, right?

Do you hate pain?

I don't like it.

But have you found what
gives you pleasure?

That's not so bad.

If you know pain and hardship,
it's easier to be kind to others.

Being kind isn't a weakness.

Yes? Hello?

It's Katsuragi.

The synch test will
be starting soon.

Fix the depth at 3.2.

I thought so. Shinji's synch ratio is dropping.

Stand up! Attention! Bow!

Lunch time!
Attention student Toji Suzuhara...

Toji Suzuhara, report to the Principal's Office.

What the...

What did you do?

I don't know.

Excuse me, I'm Toji Suzuhara.

You're Toji Suzuhara?

How was your trip to
New Yokosuka?

Way cool!

Speaking of which, I picked up
some disturbing information.

Eva Unit 03?

Yeah, the one they built in
America. It's completed, isn't it?

I don't know.

I know it's classified, but please
tell me something.

I really don't know!

Haven't you heard the rumor
that the activation test

will be held at the second test
facility in Matsushiro?

I haven't.

The pilot hasn't been
chosen yet, right?

How would I know?

Misato could pick me for it.

Shinji, would you ask her for me?
I really want to be an Eva pilot!

Really, I don't know.

What about the story that
Unit 04's been lost?

What was that?

You really don't know?

It disappeared along with the
entire Second Branch.

My dad's section was in a panic.

Really?

I think so.

Misato didn't tell me anything.

Well, I guess it doesn't directly
concern the pilots.

If she didn't tell you, it's likely
because you don't need to know.

I'm sorry about bothering you
with weird questions.

But Toji hasn't come back yet.

Thus, we, mankind,

survived the hell called the
Second Impact and rose again.

The number of children has
been decreasing yearly...

Sorry I'm late.

I know about it. Be seated.

Anyway, it is you, the young who
will lead the way to the future...

Let's go home.

What about Toji?

He'll be late.
What about Toji?

He'll be late.

He's got class duty.

The school is now closing.

All students must go to their
homes immediately.

Suzuhara!

You're on duty.

Line up the desks and write
up the daily record.

I haven't had lunch yet. I'll do
it as soon as I've eaten.

Suzuhara, you always buy your
lunch from the school shop.

That's because there's no one
who cooks for me.

Suzuhara...

I have two sisters. Their names
are Kodama and Nozomi,

and I always cook lunch for them.

That must be a lot of work.

So, I'm actually a good cook,
though you might not think it.

Really?

And I always end up cooking
too much for our lunches.

That's a waste.

If you need help getting rid of
your leftovers, I'll help.

Yes, help me.

Kaji?

Oh, Asuka? Sorry, I'm busy
right now. Can it wait?

Oh, Asuka? Sorry, I'm busy
right now. Can it wait?

But you have time to see
Misato, don't you?

Damn! Not right now!

These are our synch data reports.

Four of them?

What in the hell is this?

Who made HIM the Fourth Child?

No! I don't understand!
What is this?!

NERV, 1st Branch, USA

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

Um... Where's Asuka?

She's already left. I guess she's
bound and determined to avoid me.

Why would she do that?

I guess you still don't understand
how girls think.

-By the way--
-Are the--

You first.

Are the rumors true?
About Unit 04 being de-listed?

Something about an accident? It blew up?

Yes, the rumors are true.

Unit 04 was obliterated,
along with Nerv's Second Branch.

It happened during an S2 Drive test.

But don't you worry about us! All three
units are working just fine, right?

Our pilots and our staff
are the best of the best.

But they say Unit 03
is coming from America.

The activation test will be held
at Matsushiro, right?

Yes. I'll be out of town
for four days or so,

but Kaji will look after you,
so you'll be fine.

But is the test--

Ritsuko will be there to supervise it.
Everything will be fine.

What about the pilot?

Listen, about the pilot situation...

Come in!

Good morning!

I am here today to ask you a favor,
Major Katsuragi.

Please, ma'am! Please make me
the pilot of Evangelion Unit 03!

Huh?

So Shinji still doesn't know, then?

I just can't seem to find
the right time to bring it up.

I'm scared. There are times when I can't
figure out what he's thinking.

Well, figure it out. You're the one
who asked to be his guardian.

I know, don't remind me.

So, when will you call in the pilot?

I'm not sure. Tomorrow, probably.
There's still a lot of prep work to do.

Maybe he'll tell Shinji himself.

I doubt it.

He didn't seem happy enough
to brag about it.

He agreed on the condition that
his little sister was to be transferred

to HQ's medical department.

D***, Ms. Misato can be heartless.

If they need enthusiasm, I'm their man.

I wish they would use me,
if only as a standby pilot.

Right, Tohji?

Hm? Sure.

What happened? You left before me,
so what took you so long to get here?

What, no lover's quarrel today?

I didn't want to see your stupid face!
You or the rest of the Idiot Trio!

Okay, time to eat...

Huh? Where's Tohji?

He's not here.

Without eating lunch?
This is Tohji we're talking about.

He'd never do that.

Yeah. He's been acting weird lately.

Suzuhara?

Oh, hey, Ayanami. If you're looking
for Shinji, he's not here.

You know about me, then.
It looked like Soryu knows, too.

So Shinji's the only one who doesn't know.

It's pretty unusual for you
to worry about others.

Is it? I don't really know
what I'm feeling.

It's Shinji you're worried about.

Really?

Maybe you're right.

I am.

Hikari! Let's eat!

Two d*** hours late...
He finally graces us with his presence.

No man has ever kept me
waiting for this long.

You would always leave without waiting
when you were out on a date.

And so, this is what we now refer to
as the Second Impact.

Back then, I was living in Nebukawa,

but due to rising sea levels resulting
from the melting of Antarctica,

it is now at the bottom of the ocean.

Sorry, newbie. But I have to punch you.

I couldn't live with myself otherwise.

I'm sorry, Asuka.
I know you usually walk home with Ikari.

Don't worry about it. That's just because
I'm stuck working with Shinji.

I'm not in the mood to look
at his stupid face today.

You're thinking about Suzuhara.

Yes... You can tell?

It's written all over your face.
Only the Idiot Trio are clueless.

I don't know,
Shinji seems pretty perceptive.

He's the densest of the bunch!

He's an idiot, to boot! He doesn't
know how to act around people.

Really?

I think Suzuhara likes someone,
but it might be Ms. Ayanami.

Suzuhara? He's into Miss Perfect?

They seemed awfully chummy at lunch today.

Trust me, Hikari.
That's flat-out impossible.

When it comes to social interaction,
she's a million times denser than Shinji!

-Really?
-Yeah!

-Can I ask you something?
-What?

What do you see in that hotheaded moron?

He's really sweet.

Getting back together with you
was the worst mistake of my life!

This again?

Hey, you know--

Mr. Kaji's sure taking
a long time in the tub.

I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 03...

-Huh? No one's told you?
-Who is it?

I don't know.

Now, that was a nice bath.

What, are you two going at it again?
For crying out loud.

Is it always like this
when Katsuragi's away?

It's not that! You're spending
the night here tonight!

So I want to be all cheerful
and bubbly for you!

But not today... I can't do it!

I understand. Let's call it a night.

At times like this, going to bed
early is the smartest move.

Are you asleep, Mr. Kaji?

No, not yet.

What kind of man is my father?

That sure wasn't what I was expecting.

I thought you were going to ask
about Katsuragi.

It just seems like you're always with him.

It's the Deputy Commander
who never leaves his side.

Is this your thing,
asking everyone about your father?

There was a long stretch
where I never saw him.

Oh, you really don't know him.

But I've learned a fair amount lately.
About my father.

About his job.
About my mother. So I thought--

No, that's where you're wrong.
You only think you learned something.

Nobody can ever completely
understand another person.

Good luck even understanding yourself.

Complete understanding
between two people is impossible.

That's why people try so hard to
understand themselves and others.

It's one of the things
that makes life interesting.

Does that go for you and Misato, too?

The characters for the word "girlfriend"
literally mean "distant woman."

Women are creatures on an alien shore,
as far as we men are concerned.

A river wider and deeper than any
ocean separates men and women.

I don't understand adults at all.

T minus 300 minutes
to Unit 03 activation test.

Primary power shows green.
Secondary apoptosis nominal.

Coolants systems normal in all sectors.

Left arm locking
pressure clamps is secure.

Roger that. B Team, begin your operations.

Data link to Eva-01, status green.

At this rate, it will be
combat-ready in no time.

Oh. That's nice.

You don't sound so enthusiastic.

When this unit is delivered, it will be
placed under your direct command.

Personal control of four Evas, huh?

Gee, I could probably destroy
the world if I felt like it.

-So, have you talked to Shinji?
-I'll tell him after the tests are over.

The Fourth Children has arrived.
Team 2, expedite prep for plug entry.

He still isn't here, Asuka.

Yeah, he might not come to school today.

I thought today would
finally be the day...

Want this?

Unit 03's in Japan already, right?

Yeah. I think it came yesterday.

I'm jealous...

I wonder who's gonna be the pilot?

Tohji, maybe? I mean, he's not here today.

Come on, no way!

Entry plug locked in position.

-What happened to Misato and the rest?
-They still can't reach them.

Oh, no... What should we do?

Oh, quit your whining!

Worrying isn't going to do
anybody any good right now!

But we have to take on
an Angel on our own!

Commander Ikari is personally
assuming command.

Father is taking charge?

Target sighted as Nobeyama Heights.
Patching through to main display.

We should have known...

Transmit shutdown signal.
Activate emergency entry plug ejection.

Negative! Unit is not responding
to shutdown or ejection signals!

Pilot's vitals?

I'm reading respiration and heartbeat,
but the pilot is probably...

Evangelion Unit 03 is hereby
declared a total loss.

Target is now designated
as the 13th Angel.

But--

Set up a defense line at Nobeyama
as planned. Destroy the target.

Target approaching.

All units, prepare for ground engagement!

No way!

That's an Angel? Is it really an Angel?

That's right. It's your target.

Our target? But that's... That's an Eva!

I don't believe it...
It got taken over by an Angel?

So is there somebody in there?
A kid? A kid our age?

You still don't know?!
Unit 03's pilot is--

Asuka?

Asuka!

Eva-02, unresponsive and inactive!

Pilot has ejected! Recovery team en route!

Target moving towards Unit 00!

Rei, keep the target occupied
while avoiding close-quarters combat.

-I'll send Unit 01 your way.
-Roger.

He's inside there...

Unit 00's left arm being
infiltrated by Angel!

The nerve ganglia are being taken over!

Amputate the left arm. Hurry!

But if we don't cut
the neural link first--

-Amputate it!
-Yes, sir.

Unit 00, moderate damage. Pilot injured.

Oh, no...

The target is approaching.
It will reach you in 20.

You will destroy it.

You keep calling it a target...

But there's somebody inside there...

A kid the same age as me...

Its entry plug...
I knew it, somebody's in there!

Life support is failing!

The pilot's in danger!

D***! Lower synch rate to 60%!

Belay that.

But, Ikari, the pilot will die
if we don't do something!

Shinji, why aren't you fighting back?

There's... There's somebody
in there, Father!

Irrelevant! That thing is an Angel!
Our enemy!

But I... I can't!

We have to save him!
I can't murder somebody!

You'll die if you don't.

That's fine!
I'd rather die than kill someone!

So be it.

Sever the synchronization
between the pilot and Unit 01.

Sever it, sir?

Yes. Switch control over
to the Dummy Plug.

But, sir, the Dummy System
is still plagued with issues,

and without Dr. Akagi's supervision, it--

It will still be more useful
than this pilot. Do it!

Yes, sir.

What's that?

What did you do, Father?!

Signal reception confirmed!

Control system transfer complete.

All neural circuits now linked
to Dummy System.

32.8% of emotional parameters
indistinct. Unable to monitor.

No matter. Release all systems.
Commence attack.

This is what a Dummy Plug can do...?

-All systems nominal.
-Gain continuing to climb!

Stop it!

Father, stop! You've got to stop this!

D*** it, stop!

Stop!

Don't do it!

No!

Eva-03... Scratch that.

The target has been
rendered completely inert.

I think I'll make this one.

Big sis Kodama, Nozomi, and me.

Lunch for four.

I sure hope he'll eat it tomorrow!

Over here! I've got another survivor!

I've got breathing!
Get a med team over here!

I'm alive...

Kaji?

I'm glad you made it, Katsuragi.

Is Ritsuko...

Don't worry. She got off easier than you.

Oh... What about Eva-03?

Designated as an Angel
and neutralized. By Unit 01.

I... I never told Shinji.

Shinji?

Ms. Misato, you're okay?

I... I'm sorry.

It was important,
and I should have told you.

I never thought this would...

Ms. Misato, I... I killed someone...

I begged my father to stop, but he...

Shinji, I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

We got word from the entry plug
recovery team. The pilot is alive.

He's alive!

Listen, about Unit 03's pilot...

The Fourth Children, it's...

Tohji...

Shinji?

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Linkage circuits with Unit 01
have been severed.

Plug eject signal?

It's been locked out by the pilot.
It's not being received.

Look, Shinji, if we hadn't done
what we did, you'd have been killed!

That doesn't make it okay.

That's the cold, hard truth.

Don't say things like that,
you'll only make me angrier.

Unit 01 has 185 seconds left.

That's more than enough
to demolish half of HQ.

Given his state of mind right now,
he might do it.

Shinji, listen to us!

If the Commander didn't make that call,
we all might have been killed!

I said, that doesn't make it okay!

Father... That monster
tried to kill Tohji!

Using me to do it!

Father! You're there, aren't you?

Say something! Answer me!

Raise the LCL pressure density
to maximum levels.

I don't have time to deal
with childish tantrums.

I still have the direct control circuits--

D*** it...

The right breast has been dissolved.

Bodily fluid cleanup
will begin as planned in 30.

Part no. 6 will be incinerated.

-Shouldn't you be resting?
-I can still do my job.

I can't stay in bed,
not during a full-blown crisis.

What happened with Shinji?

They used a laser torch
to cut through the emergency hatch.

They dragged him out.

What a mess. This might be...

...the end of the line for him.

He's not going to bounce back,
not from this. Not a chance.

How is Shinji?

He's not physically hurt.
He'll wake up soon enough.

I bet he's dreaming right now.

-Dreaming?
-Yeah.

What, you've never dreamed before?

Shinji?

How come Shinji's lying
in the bed next to mine?

Where am I? My sister's hospital?

Huh? That's Shinji and Ayanami.

Shinji, why would you do such a thing?

I couldn't forgive him. He betrayed me.

My own father betrayed me.

I was finally starting to enjoy
talking to him, and he does this!

He doesn't give a d*** about how I feel!

Did you try to understand him?
What he might be feeling?

I did try.

-Why don't you try?
-I tried, I really did!

There you go again,
running away from things that hurt.

What's wrong with that?

What's wrong with running away
from hurt and pain?!

Geez, what are those two fighting about?

We're making a special exception.
Just five minutes.

I understand. Thank you, ma'am.

Oh, hey, Class Rep.

Are you okay, Suzuhara?

Yeah. I'm alive, I guess.

Huh? I thought Shinji was over there.
Did I dream that?

They said he was discharged yesterday.

You've been asleep for three days.

Oh, wow... Three whole days?

What brings you here?

Uh, I'm here on official business
as the elected class representative!

It's part of my duties, that's all!

Sure. I understand.

No, you don't.

I'm sorry.

I never ate any of your lunches.

That's okay, don't worry about it.

I'm sorry. They said I couldn't
bring in a lunch for you.

Class Rep?

Yes?

Could you do me a favor?

What?

Could you tell my sister
that I wasn't hurt?

Sure.

Come out, Shinji Ikari.

The Supreme Commander will see you now.

Disobeying orders. Misappropriation
of an Eva. Childish threats.

These are all criminal acts.

Do you have anything to say for yourself?

Yes. I never want to pilot an Eva again.

-I don't want to be here anymore, either.
-Then get out.

Yes, sir. I'll go back
to my teacher's place.

You're running away again?

I'm disappointed in you.
We probably won't see each other again.

Yes, sir. That’s my intention as well.

It's me. Delete the entry
for the Third Children.

Set Rei as Unit 01's
default designated pilot.

Set the Dummy Plug as the backup.

Shinji?

Is it true that you're leaving town?

It's true, isn't it?

But why? Why are you running away now?

I looked up to you.

I was so jealous of you.
Because you're not like the rest of us.

D*** it, even Tohji
got to be an Eva pilot, but I--

This call is monitored.

For security reasons,
this call has been terminated.

Thank you for your understanding.

Asuka is too disgusted to see me off, huh?

Yeah. She didn't even ask me
to give you her regards.

That's just Asuka being Asuka.
I'm relieved to hear that.

You're going to have a tough time in life
if you keep on trying to please everyone.

That's how you live your life.
I can't live that way.

I think you realize this,

but there will be a lot of restrictions
on your actions from now on.

Yes, ma'am.

-Um...
-Yes?

Just tell me one thing.

Why Tohji? Why was he the Fourth Children?

Your classmates are all
fourth-round selection candidates.

I just found out, myself.
It was all arranged. Everything.

Everyone is... Everyone in my class?

As for what happened to Suzuhara,
no apology can ever undo that.

But to be honest, Shinji,

I had placed all my dreams,
hopes, and goals on you.

I know how heavy a burden that is for you.

But all of us at Nerv had no choice
but to entrust our future to you.

Just remember that, okay?

-That's a self-serving excuse.
-I know, it is.

I won't change your HQ access passcode,
and I'll leave your room as-is.

Don't bother.
Please get rid of everything.

I'll never pilot an Eva again.

He was speaking assertively this time.
He's never done that before.

A special state of emergency has been
declared in and around the Toukai region.

All residents, please proceed to your
designated shelter immediately.

-I repeat...
-It's an Angel...

All personnel,
condition one battle stations!

Surface-to-air battle, stand by!

-Target status?
-Currently advancing.

Komagatake defense line has been breached.

Armor belts 1-18 destroyed!

Eighteen layers of special armor,
gone in an instant!

It's too late for an Eva intercept
on the surface!

Station Unit 02 inside the Geo-front!
Task it to HQ facility point defense!

Have Asuka open fire
the instant it makes it inside!

Unit 00's status?

Stationed at the A.T. Field
neutralization point!

Its left arm hasn't regenerated yet.
So it can't fight...

Send Rei out in Unit 01.

-Prepare a Dummy Plug as a backup.
-Yes, sir.

Start entry sequence.

Ionizing LCL.

Initiate A10 nerve connection.

This won't work... Not anymore.

Pulse flow reversing!

Unit 01 is rejecting neural connection!

What? That's not possible!

Ikari...

Yes. This is a rejection of me.

Abort activation.
Have Rei launch in Unit 00.

Reactivate Unit 01 using the Dummy Plug.

But Unit 00 is still--

-It's fine. I'll go.
-Rei!

Even if I die, there are replacements.

I promised myself
I would never pilot it again.

You there! What are you doing?!
Get to a shelter!

Situation critical!

One more blast, and all
armor layers will be breached!

We're counting on you, Asuka.

Okay, here it comes...

Who cares if Shinji isn't here!
I can handle it myself, no problem!

Come on!

D***! What's next?

Its A.T. Field is supposed
to be neutralized!

Why won't you die, d*** it?!

I'm not gonna get beaten! Not again!

No way!

You *** d*** swine!

Asuka!

Cut all neural connections! Now!

An evacuation drill? Are you stupid?

We're pilots! We don't evacuate!

Direct hit to ward no. 8!

Abandon shelter no. 6!
All survivors, proceed to shelter no.3!

Unit 02 severely damaged!
It's out of action!

-How's Asuka?
-Unharmed! She's alive!

D*** it...

Angel has resumed advance!

Unit 01's status?

-Dummy Plug has been installed.
-Probe insertion complete.

-Initiate contact.
-Roger!

-What's wrong?
-Pulses lost! It's refusing the dummy!

It's not working!
Eva-01 will not activate!

First Rei... Now the Dummy System...

It's not accepting them?

Fuyutsuki. Take care of things
here for a minute.

Get the injured to block no. 6!

Get all the uninjured
to shelter no. 3 right now!

-This way!
-Hurry!

-Move it!
-Hurry!

Hey, kid! What are you doing?!
Do you want to get killed?!

Asuka...

Is that you, Shinji?

Mr. Kaji?

What are you doing out here?

That's my line.
What are you doing, Shinji?

I... I'm not going to pilot
my Eva anymore.

I made up my mind.

I see.

They found out about my side job.

Now I don't have a station
to man during combat.

I've been stuck watering
my plants ever since.

At a time like this?

Because it's a time like this.

Between Katsuragi's breasts would be nice,

but when I die,
this is where I really want to be.

Die?

That's right.

If an Angel comes into contact with Adam,
who's sleeping under us,

it's said that all humanity
will be destroyed.

It will be the Third Impact.

Only something with the power
of an Angel can prevent that.

Only an Evangelion.

Ayanami? She doesn't even have a rifle!

-She's going to blow herself up?!
-Rei!

A.T. Field to maximum.

Is Unit 00...

Rei!

What has she done?

Shinji? All I can do
is water my plants here.

But you... There's something
that only you can do.

Something that only you
are capable of doing.

Nobody will force you.

Think it over and decide for yourself.

Figure out what you need to do right now.

So you don't have any regrets later,
you know?

Direct hit to foundation section no.3!

The final armor bulkhead has melted away!

D*** it! The main shaft
is completely exposed!

Any luck with Unit 01?

Dummy Plug rejected!

Negative! No response!

Keep going. Start again from 108.

Let me pilot it!

Let me... Let me pilot...
Let me pilot Unit 01!

Father...

Why are you here?

I... I'm the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01!

I'm Shinji Ikari!

Target has entered main shaft!

Now descending!

Where's it headed?!

It's heading straight for
the Central Dogma!

It's headed this way!
All personnel, evacuate! Hurry!

All personnel, evacuate!
I repeat, all personnel, evacuate!

Eva-01?!

Shinji?!

-Ms. Misato!
-Launch platform no. 5! Hurry!

I'm out of power!

Unit 01 has reached active time limit!
Backups are also down!

Shinji!

Shinji!

Move!

Come on, move! If you don't move,
this will all be for nothing!

Is that the...

Move!

Come on, move!

If you don't move now... If I can't
do this now, everybody's gonna die!

I don't want that, not anymore!

So I'm begging you! Move!

Th-The Eva has reactivated.

Incredible...

Impossible! I don't believe it!

Unit 01's synch rate is over 400%!

Does this mean... she's awake?

It's eating the Angel...

Is it trying to incorporate
its S2 Drive into itself?

Is that what Eva-01 is doing?

The restraints!

Restraints?

Yes. Those aren't armor plating.

They're restraints we put on the Evas
to contain their intrinsic power.

It's using brute force
to break free of our control.

We humans can no longer keep
that Eva under our control.

The awakening and liberation of Unit 01...

Seele won't take this lying down.

Is this also part of your scenario,
Commander Ikari?

It's begun, hasn't it?

Yes. It all starts now.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

It's eating the Angel...

It's using brute force
to break free of our control.

We humans can no longer keep
that Eva under our control.

The awakening and liberation of Unit 01...

Seele won't take this lying down.

The Eva series aren't meant to be able
to generate an S2 Drive on their own.

Who could have predicted an Eva could
assimilate an S2 Drive in such manner.

This turn of events is in no way
part of Seele's scenario!

Compensating for this
will be no small task.

Perhaps entrusting Nerv
to Gendoh Ikari, to that man,

was a mistake in the first place.

But if it were not for that man, we could
not have set any of our plans in motion.

Ikari, what are you thinking?

It's begun, hasn't it?

Yes. It all starts now.

The damage to the two Evas
is well beyond the Hayflick limit.

It's going to be a while before things
get back to the way they were.

Fortunately, the Magi System
is designed to be transferable.

We can start work as early as tomorrow.

But this place is a total loss.

It's only a matter of time
before they decide to condemn it.

I agree.

In the meantime,

we'll have to make do with this, the
backup Secondary Command Center.

Even without the Magi?

Yes.

We'll dust off the cobwebs
and get down to work this afternoon.

The chairs are hard,
and the sensors aren't responsive.

We can't be as productive
as we were before.

This place's layout is identical to
our old First Command Center, but still...

Yes, it feels off somehow.

All that matters now
is that it's operational.

The big question
is whether or not Unit 01 is.

Will restraining it
using the cage be enough?

We're not detecting any thermal,
electrical, EM,

or chemical energy readings
from inside it.

The S2 Drive is completely inert.

That hasn't stopped Unit 01 from
coming to life three times in the past.

We can't fiddle around with it
based only on what we can see.

There's no telling what it might do to us
if we start poking at it blindly.

Just like you, Major Katsuragi.

Sorry, ma'am.

Unit 01 isn't our only problem, though.

Indeed. Units 00 and 02
are severely damaged.

Nerv headquarters, partially destroyed.
The Central Dogma lies exposed.

This damage is catastrophic!

There is no telling how much time
and money this has cost us.

This happened because there is
no bell around Ikari's neck.

-We put one there. It just didn't ring.
-A bell that doesn't ring is meaningless.

We'll make the bell take action next time.

My, my. This is certainly
an unexpected development, isn't it?

How are you going to explain this
to the Council? To Seele, rather.

At the time,
Unit 01 was not under our control.

This was an unfortunate accident.

As such, Unit 01 is grounded.
Until further orders from the Council.

An appropriate response. However...

Is your son still absorbed into it?

No luck, ma'am. It's not accepting
the plug ejection signal.

-The backup and simulated signals?
-Also rejected, ma'am.

Direct control circuits
won't connect, either.

I've patched into
the plug's visual circuit.

Putting it on the main screen.

What in... the heck?

This is what a synchronization rate
of 400% looks like.

What do you mean?!
What the heck happened to Shinji?!

He's been assimilated into Eva-01.

What's that even mean?
What the heck are the Evas?!

They can only be described as objects
similar in shape to a human

that was created by humans.

"Created by humans"?

All you did was copy something
you found in Antarctica!

Don't even try to claim they're originals.

They're not just a simple copy.
They've been given human will.

-You're saying this is somebody's will?
-Perhaps the Eva has--

Fix this, d*** it!

You built the things, didn't you?!
Whatever it takes, make this right!

The government and Home Ministry
both officially deny

any involvement in the incident
at the Spratly Islands.

In other news, today marks one month

since the Tokyo-2
terrorist attack by a leftist,

and the SSDF briefed the press
on a mop-up operation to...

I'm still alive.

Fine, so she was alive!

I don't need you to call
and bother me with that crap, Misato!

I couldn't... I couldn't do
a d*** thing to stop it.

That Idiot Shinji upstaged me again!

I hate this!

A salvage operation to recover Shinji?

Yes, the lifeform that we call
"Shinji" still exists.

Is that respect for human life I hear?

Losing Shinji now is out of the question.

I'll just bet. It's not Shinji's life
that Nerv is interested in.

They don't want to lose Unit 01 as a tool.

I won't deny that.

We hypothesize that Shinji's body
has lost its ego boundary delineation

and he's drifting in the entry plug
in a quantum state.

You're saying that Shinji's
been transformed into a state

that we can't detect visually?

Yes, ma'am.

The makeup of the LCL in the entry plug
has undergone a chemical change.

It's now very similar
to seawater on primitive Earth.

The primordial soup, huh?

All the matter that comprises Shinji
is still preserved within the plug,

and what can be called his soul
is also still there.

The proof is that his mental self-image
is manifesting a facsimile of his suit.

So by "salvage operation,"
we mean reconstituting his body

and affixing his psyche inside it.

-Is that even possible?
-With the Magi's support, yes.

Theoretically, you mean.
You won't actually know until you try.

What is this? Where am I?

An entry plug? Unit 01's.

But there's nobody in it. I'm not in it.

What is this?

I don't understand.

Who are these people?

Oh. These are the people I know.
The people who know me.

Oh, I get it. This is everything
that makes up my world.

What's this?

This is supposed to be my world,
but I'm not sure what this is.

A projection from outside.
A projection I don't like.

Oh, right! It's an enemy!

Enemy!

Our enemies! Things we call Angels
that bear divine names.

The Evas' target... Nerv's target!

The things that killed Misato's father!

Why am I fighting them?
When it means going through this...

Don't be an idiot!

Those freaky things are attacking us!

When you're attacked,
it's only natural to defend yourself!

Maybe we don't need a reason.
Maybe I shouldn't think about it.

Enemy!

They're all my enemies!

Anything that threatens me is an enemy!
Anything that threatens us!

She's right! What's wrong with
defending yourself? Defending ourselves?

Enemy!

My enemy!

D*** you!

You hurt Tohji! You murdered Mother!

Father!

Why do you hate your father?

Why wouldn't I hate a father like him?

Don't you know your father?

How could I? I hardly ever see him.

-Is that why you hate him?
-Yes!

He doesn't want me! He abandoned me!

Am I your substitute?

Yes, you are! That has to be it!

I was cast aside because he has you!

You were the one who decided to run away.

Shut up!

It's all Father's fault!

I came to Nerv that day
to tell him that I hated him!

Are you saying to get into this and have
terrifying things happen to me, Father?

-Correct.
-What?

No, I don't want to do that!
What are you saying?!

I thought you left me
because you didn't need me!

I do now, so I sent for you.

But why me?!

Because it's impossible for anyone else.

It is for me, too. I've never seen
or heard of this thing before.

I can't possibly do it!

No, I recognized the Eva.

That's right! I recognized this Eva!

And on that day, I ran away!
From Father and Mother!

LCL temperature holding steady at 38°C.
Oxygen levels are green.

Radiated EM pulse function, nominal.
Wave pattern is Bravo.

All monitoring instrumentation
is functioning normally.

A salvage operation outline...

Only you could have put this together
in just one month, Senpai.

I wish I could take the credit,
but it's not my proposal.

This data is from experiments
conducted ten years ago.

Something like this happened before?
During the Evas' development?

It happened before I joined Nerv.

My mother witnessed it firsthand,
but I only know about it from our files.

What happened
when they tried the procedure?

They failed, apparently.

So much kindness... It's so warm.

Is this what human warmth feels like?

I had no idea.

What does "lonely" mean?

I never understood it before,
but now I think I do.

What does "happy" mean?

I never understood it before,
but now I think I do.

Are they kind to you? Other people?

-Yeah.
-Why is that?

Because I'm an Eva pilot.

They take care of me
because I pilot the Eva!

That's what lets me stay here.
It's the only reason they put up with me.

-That's why I need to pilot the Eva.
-And then what?

And fight. Right, I need to fight
the things they say are our enemies!

And then what?

I need to win.

Right, I can't lose...

I have to do as I'm told
and pilot the Eva.

I have to do as I'm told and fight!

That’s the only way... people will say...

-Keep it up.
-Do your best.

What are you doing? Get your act together!

Kick some a**!

Keep it up!

Well done, Shinji.

Ms. Misato and Ms. Ritsuko and Asuka

and Tohji and Kensuke and Father,

they all praise me!

They praise me when I pilot the Eva!

They all tell me to pilot it!

I’m going to impress Father.
The Father that abandoned me!

Keep it up.

I'm trying! I'm trying my hardest...

So, somebody, be kind to me...

I've fought so hard!
I'm fighting as hard as I can!

So take care of me! Be kind to me!

I am kind to you.

Shinji? Do you want to become one with me?

Do you want to become one, body and soul?

It's something that feels
really, really good.

I’m ready, Shinji.
I’m always ready for you.

Hey, Idiot Shinji. Do you want
to become one with me?

Do you want to become one, body and soul?

It's something that feels
really, really good.

This is me who's asking, okay?
So get your butt over here.

Shinji, do you want to become one with me?

Do you want to become one, body and soul?

It's something that feels
really, really good, Shinji.

Do you want to become one with me?

Do you want to become one, body and soul?

It's something that feels
really, really good.

Come on, relax. Just let your heart go.

All probes now inserted.

EM wave pattern has been fixed
at zero minus three.

Connection to ego boundary pulse complete.

Roger. Commence salvage procedure.

Roger that. Now sending signal one.

Eva is receiving signal.
No sign of rejection.

Proceeding with transmission
of signals two and three.

Subject cathexis shows normal.

No signs of destrudo detected.

Roger. Transfer subject to stage two.

Shinji...

Idiot Shinji!

Shinji!

'Sup, Shinji!

Hey, Shinji!

Shinji.

Shinji!

-Idiot Shinji!
-Shinji!

-'Sup, Shinji!
-Hey, Shinji!

-Shinji.
-Shinji!

It's not working!
His ego boundary is trapped in a loop!

Try broadcasting the full waveform
spectrum in all directions!

It's not getting through. Our signals
are being trapped in Klein space.

-What does that mean?
-It means we failed.

Abort intervention. Reverse tangent graph!

-Return offset value to zero.
-Yes, ma'am!

Destrudo readings in primitive
cortical area! Pattern Sepia!

Core pulse is also fluctuating!
It's gone to plus 0.3!

Our top priority is maintaining
its current state.

-Prevent a backflow!
-Yes, ma'am!

Plus 0.5, 0.8... This is strange!
I can't slow it down!

What? Why?

Don't you want to come back, Shinji?

I don't know.

I...

What do you wish for?

What do you wish for?

What do you wish for?

What do you wish for?

Eva is rejecting signal!

The LCL's self-assembly is breaking down!

Pressure climbing inside plug!

Abort all operations! Cut the power!

It's not working!
The plug is beginning exit sequence!

Shinji!

-Where am I?
-Inside the Eva.

Inside the Eva? I got into it again?

Why?

You aren't going to pilot the Eva anymore?

I promised myself that I wouldn't
get into the Eva again.

But you did get into it.
Into Evangelion Unit 01.

Shinji, you're here right now
because you got into the Eva.

You're the person you are now
because you piloted the Eva.

You can't reject that.
The fact that you piloted the Eva.

You can't reject your past
or who you were.

What you need to do is think hard
about what you want to become.

And choose for yourself.

I...

What's the point of science
if it can't save one person?! Just one!

Give Shinji back! Give him back to me!

A smell? The smell of a person...

Ms. Misato? Ayanami?

No, it's someone else.

Oh, I know... It smells like Mother.

Will our baby have to grow up in
the aftermath of the Second Impact?

In this hell?

Oh, as long as you have the will to live,
you can turn anywhere into paradise.

After all, you're alive.

Opportunities for happiness
can be found everywhere.

Yes, of course. You're right.

Mother...

Have you decided?

Shinji if it's a boy. Rei if it's a girl.

Shinji... Rei...

Mother...

Shinji!

Repairs on Unit 01 will be finished
the day after tomorrow.

So, in the end, we humans will use
even the power of God as a tool.

I wonder. I heard the Council is
thinking about grounding Unit 01.

Evangelion, the artificial human...

For something we created, don't you think
they have way too many unknowns?

Well, I guess the important thing
is that we managed to save Shinji.

I had nothing to do with it.
I think that was all your doing.

Hey, it's been a long time.
Want to get a drink?

-Sorry. I have plans tonight.
-Ah.

Later.

The instant she knows Shinji's safe,
she runs off for a secret tryst...

I suppose I'm not one to talk.

I bet Ritsuko is looking down
her nose at me

right about now, thinking I'm indecent.

You're truer to the human condition
when you indulge in carnal desires.

The deception should hold for a while.

Against who, Nerv Intelligence?
Or Commander Ikari or Ritsuko?

Or do you mean me?

No, yourself.

"Others," don't you mean?

You're not all that interested in others,
but you always feel lonely.

You really are like my father.

I didn't know you still smoked.

Only after doing this.
So you're the only one who knows.

Goodness, I'm honored.

So, tell me... How far along is
the Human Instrumentality Project?

If it can destroy humanity, why are
we keeping Adam in our basement?

Is that why you hook up with me?
You want info on that stuff?

That's part of it, to be honest.

I'm deeply honored to be exploited
by a fine lady such as yourself...

but I can't talk about that here.

Right now, I just want you
to know what I want.

What are Nerv
and Commander Ikari really after?

I want to know that myself.

Hey, buster,
you can't distract me by doing that...

Hey! Watch what you're sticking in there!

You're messing around now? What is that?

A present from me.
The first one in eight years.

Maybe the last I ever give you.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

Hello. I'm not home right now.
Leave a message after the beep.

One last job to do.

It's the same color as blood.

What do you mean,
the deputy commander's been abducted?

It happened two hours ago.

His last confirmed location
was in Ward Eight in the west.

Wait, that's inside this facility!

Were you guys at Intel asleep on the job?

They had an inside man who was
leaking Intel and stirring up trouble.

He gave us the runaround.

A man who could outwit Intel Section Two?

Oh, don't tell me...

Ryoji Kaji. We believe him to be
the mastermind behind the disappearance.

Which is why you came to see me.

It's helpful that you catch on so quickly.

As colleagues, we hate having to suspect
our own chief of operations,

but this is our job.

Considering my history with him,
it's the logical step to take.

Thank you for your cooperation. Bring her.

It's been quite some time, Chairman Keel.

This is a rather rough welcome,
don't you think?

Apologies for rude behavior
are not warranted here.

We needed to have an uninterrupted chat.
It was the logical step to take.

You never change. My convenience
has never been a concern for you.

This matter requires immediate attention.
It couldn't be helped.

Please understand.

It must be, if you're appearing to me
as Seele rather than the Council.

We have no intention
of creating a new god.

We require your assistance,
Professor Fuyutsuki.

"Professor Fuyutsuki," is it?

Professor! Professor Fuyutsuki!

Oh, hello, boys.

Have any plans, sir?
Want to grab a beer at Kamogawa?

Again?

Ryoko and her friends say they'll come,
but only if you do.

The other professors say you ought
to join in every once in a while.

All right, all right.

It's good for you to go out
for a drink every now and again.

Yes, sir.

You're very talented,
but you should give more thought

to cultivating relationships.

I'll take that to heart, sir.

By the way, Fuyutsuki,
there's a student over in Bioengineering

who's put together a fascinating report.

Do you know a student
by the name of Ikari?

Ikari? No, sir.

When I mentioned you and your work, Ikari
expressed an interest in meeting you.

This student will be in touch soon.
Be accommodating, will you?

"Ikari," was it? Very well, sir.

METAPHYSICAL BIO, LAB NO.1
(FUYUTSUKI)

I've taken the liberty
of reading your report.

There are a few points I'm not sold on,
but it was a stimulating read.

Thank you, sir.

"Yui Ikari," was it?

Yes, sir.

What are your plans after graduation?

Get a job in the private sector?
Or take a position at a lab here, perhaps?

I haven't thought that far ahead yet.
And isn't there also a third option?

I've also thought about starting a family.
Assuming I meet the right person.

AGAIN, IN 2015 A.D.

By assimilating that S2 Drive...

it has attained absolute existence.

Evangelion Unit 01...

A manifested god is of no use to us.

We mustn't create a god.

Much less allow it
to fall into that man's hands.

Gendoh Ikari... Can this man be trusted?

Gendoh Rokubungi?
Yes, I've heard the name.

No, I've never personally met him.

But he is the sort of man
whose reputation precedes him.

What? He's asking to be released
into my custody?

No, I'll come down.
When would be a good time?

I heard about you from a mutual friend.

I wanted to meet you for myself.

I wasn't expecting you to be
the trashy sort who gets into bar brawls.

He took a swing at me
before I could talk my way out of it.

Being liked makes me uncomfortable.
I'm far more used to being an outcast.

Well, your social skills
have nothing to do with me.

Prof. Fuyutsuki, you seem to be exactly
the sort of man I hoped you would be.

My first impression was that he was
a thoroughly unpleasant man.

It was autumn at the time. This was back
when this country still had seasons.

-Is that true?
-Yes.

I'm in a relationship with Mr. Rokubungi.

I could not hide my surprise
when I heard those words.

I'm surprised you have anything in common.

Now, now, Professor Fuyutsuki.
He's actually very charming.

No one knows it, that's all.

Then perhaps ignorance really is bliss.

Was my introducing you an imposition?

No. He's an interesting man, to be sure.
But I can't bring myself to like him.

In my circles, it was widely thought that
he had fostered a relationship with Yui

to gain access to her talents
and the group she was associated with.

Later on, I heard rumors that
this group's name was "Seele."

ANTARCTICA, 2000 A.D.

The Second Impact.

That tragedy struck
in the final year of the 20th Century.

And the first year of the 21st Century
could only be described as Hell.

There are no other words
to describe that year.

2002 A.D.

It's hard to believe that this
was once a continent of ice.

It's utterly unrecognizable.

Professor Fuyutsuki.

Oh, it's you.
I'm amazed you're still alive.

I heard you were on
the Katsuragi Expedition.

As luck would have it, I had returned
to Japan the day beforehand,

so I managed to avoid the tragedy.

I see. Look, Rokubungi--

Excuse me, Professor,
but I've changed my name.

A postcard? Not a business card?

WE'RE MARRIED!
GENDOH AND YUI IKARI

Ikari... Gendoh Ikari?

The missus insisted that I give this
to you, Professor. She's quite the fan.

I'm honored to hear that.

So, how is Yui? She's not coming
on this field expedition?

She wanted to come with us,
but we have a child now.

This organization you belong to.
Seele, was it?

I've heard nothing but bad things.

I can't say I approve of the way
they strong-arm the Security Council.

As principled as ever, I see.

But these days, no organization
that plays by the rules can survive.

This official investigation
of the Second Impact...

It would raise suspicions if it were
composed entirely of Seele members.

That's why the rest of us
were brought in, isn't it?

2015 A.D.

NERV ISOLATION FACILITY NO.4

I still don't like dark places.
Bad things always come back to me.

Who is she?

The sole survivor
of the original expedition.

2002 A.D.

Her name is Misato Katsuragi.

Katsuragi?
The daughter of Doctor Katsuragi?

Yes. She hasn't spoken a single word
in nearly two years.

That poor girl...

Whatever she saw,
it was bad enough to do that.

Mental trauma can take longer to heal
than simple physical injuries.

Very true.

Releasing our findings
will require careful attention.

Everything about this
giant of light is a mystery.

Afterwards, the UN would officially report
that the Second Impact was caused by

the impact of a meteor of enormous mass.

In my eyes, however,
it was clear that this was a cover-up.

I could catch hints of Seele, and a man
called Keel, at work behind the scenes.

I wanted to learn more about
the dark truth behind this incident.

Even if the name "Yui Ikari" popped up.

Why would you conceal
the existence of the giant?

Your group knew the Second Impact
was coming, didn't it?

You knew it would happen that day.

You mentioned that you were lucky enough
to leave the day before the incident.

Was it also luck that you gathered all of
your research material before you left?

I thought all those
had been incinerated. I'm surprised.

I've looked into your finances.

I realize that it takes
a lot of money to raise a child,

but don't you think you have far more
than any individual needs?

Impressive as ever, Professor Fuyutsuki.

Perhaps you should change
your field to economics.

I'm going public with how your Seele group

and the Dead Sea Scrolls
are connected to the Second Impact.

I refuse to let those responsible
get away with it!

As you wish.

But before you do that,
there's something I want you to see.

We're certainly going down a long way...

-Does that worry you?
-Somewhat, yes.

What on earth?

A structure that was left behind
by someone who wasn't us.

Eighty-nine percent of it is buried.

Then this was originally a perfectly
spherical underground space?

All of mankind's resources
are being poured into that installation.

Oh, hello, Professor Fuyutsuki.

Akagi? You're involved in this, too?

Yes.

This is the best place to work out
the basic theories

underpinning the biological computers
I'm trying to create.

I'm going to call them the Magi.

Magi? The three wise men from the East?

-Is that what you wanted to show me?
-No.

This way, please.

Ritsuko, we'll be right back.

What on earth...
Surely you didn't bring that giant here!

We Gehirn members
refer to that object as "Adam."

This isn't the giant.
It's not the original.

-So this is...
-Yes.

This is Eva, created by man from Adam.

Eva?

This is the prototype of the Adam
Rebirth Project, also called Project-E.

Eva-00.

The prototype of a god?

Fuyutsuki, will you join me in forging
a new history for mankind?

2015 A.D.

Um, Senpai?

Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's get Rei re-tested right away.

I haven't seen Ms. Katsuragi around today.

Oh, I hadn't noticed.

Ms. Katsuragi?

Yep, Misato Katsuragi!
Pleased to meet'cha!

Mother, I met a girl named
Katsuragi the other day.

People tend to give me a wide berth.

Whenever that happens, it drives home
how much weight your name carries.

But not her. She's totally at ease
around me for some reason.

I learned that she was the sole survivor
of that doomed expedition.

She says she lost the ability
to speak for a while,

but the way she goes on and on now,
it's like she's making up for lost time.

Ritchan, I'm still spending
all my time underground here.

I'm really tired of the boxed
lunches they give us.

The Tokyo-3 project is underway topside

as part of the 2nd Capital
Transfer Project.

Misato was away from school for a while,
and when I made her tell me why,

I couldn't believe it.

She said she'd been in bed
with her boyfriend the whole time.

They had just stayed there in bed
for a whole week.

I feel like I've learned about a side
to her I never knew existed.

She introduced me to him today.

He's handsome, but I'll never get used
to that carefree attitude of his.

Boys have never been your strong suit,
have they, Ritchan?

Maybe being raised by a single mother...

I'm sorry. I was never
a hands-on parent, was I?

I'm terrible, I only act like a mother
when it doesn't take any effort.

Act like a mother...

2004 A.D.

HAKONE,
UNDERGROUND TESTING FACILITY NO.2

LCL pressure, +0.2.

No destrudo readings in transmitter.

-What is this child doing here?
-That's Director Ikari's son.

Ikari, this isn't a daycare center.
Today is an important day.

Sorry, Professor Fuyutsuki.
I was the one who brought him.

Yui? This is your experiment today.

That's exactly why. I want him to see
that he has a bright future ahead of him.

Those were Ms. Yui's last words.

That freak accident wiped her
from the face of the earth.

Just as I had hoped.

I'm a terrible woman, aren't I?

Ritchan, Director Ikari was
a changed man after that day.

Where have you been all week?

Grieve all you want, but remember that you
have responsibilities beyond yourself now.

I'm well aware. Fuyutsuki,
I'm proposing a new project today.

I've already submitted it
to Chairman Keel.

Surely you don't mean...

I do. The path to attain godhood,
which no one has ever achieved.

The Human Instrumentality Project.

2008 A.D.

Mother, congratulations on completing
the basic theories for the Magi.

To coincide with your success,
I'm happy to tell you

I've been informally accepted into Gehirn.

I'm set to work as part of Project-E,
starting next month.

Who's there?

Ritsuko Akagi, Technology
Development Department. My ID.

I heard that the Command Center
has been framed out, so I came to see it.

It's a real maze here, though.

The Director is there
with Dr. Akagi right now.

-Are you sure?
-Yes.

I have no regrets about my work.

Liar. You can't let go of Ms. Yui.

But I can live with that.

2010 A.D.

GEO-FRONT ARTIFICIAL CANOPY

VENTRAL POINT DEFENSE EMPLACEMENT NO.2
(PLANNED SITE)

That's Gehirn HQ.

Good morning, Director.
You have your son with you today?

Oh, I thought you had a boy.

This isn't Shinji.
I'm looking after a friend's daughter.

Her name is Rei Ayanami.

Hi there, Rei.

She reminds me of someone...

Ms. Yui?

All files pertaining to Rei Ayanami
have been deleted.

She's a blank slate. What's going on?

SUPERCOMPUTER MAGI SYSTEM
COMPLETED

Magus Casper, Magus Balthasar,
and Magus Melchior.

The Magi are the three sides of me.
Me as a scientist.

Me as a mother. Me as a woman.

Those three sides
are constantly vying for control.

Three of you, Mother...

All that's left is to power it on.

I'm leaving early today.
Misato is coming back.

Oh, right.
She's also joined Gehirn, hasn't she?

In Germany, right?

Yes, she works at the Third Branch.

-A long-distance relationship, then?
-She says they broke up.

Oh? That's too bad.
They seemed like the perfect couple.

Men and women are hard to figure out.
There's no logic to it.

Ever the aloof ice queen, I see.

Careful, happiness
is going to pass you by.

I have even more trouble with
how to define happiness.

I should go. It's been forever
since I went out for a drink.

-Good work today.
-You, too.

Can I help you, Rei?

I got lost.

Oh, really? Well, do you want me
to show you the way out?

No.

But you can't find your way out
by yourself, right?

I don't need your help, you hag.

What?

I can find my own way out,
so leave me alone, you hag.

Calling someone a hag is very rude.

But you are one, aren't you?

You're making me angry.
You need a scolding from Director Ikari.

-He's the one who says that about you.
-What?

Things like, "That hag is such a nag."
Or, "I don't need that hag anymore."

"That hag is such a nag."
"I don't need that hag anymore."

"I don't need that hag anymore."
He's the one who says that.

"I don't need that hag anymore."

Even if you die, there will be another
to take your place, Rei...

Just like me.

On that day, the Human Instrumentality
Project, chaired by Keel Lorenz,

dissolved Gehirn,
its research organization.

The Special Agency Nerv was founded

as the execution organization
for all of its projects.

And then we were all
transferred over to Nerv.

Except for Dr. Akagi,

the key figure behind
the development of the Magi System.

2015 A.D.

-Oh, it's you.
-It's been a while, sir.

The guard outside is getting
a little shut-eye.

Doing this will mean your neck.

I just want to get closer to the truth.

The truth inside me.

Thank you for your cooperation.

-I'm free to go?
-Yes. The issue has been resolved.

I see.

-And him?
-Unknown, ma'am.

Hi. What took you so long?

I'm home.

MESSAGE

PLAY MESSAGES

Hi, Katsuragi. It's me.

By the time you get this message,
I've probably made life difficult for you.

Sorry about that.
And apologize to Ritchan for me, okay?

I shouldn't be asking favors,
but I've been growing some flowers.

If you could water them for me,
I'd appreciate it.

Shinji knows where they are.

Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
Keep going and don't look back.

If I see you again...

I'll say the words that I couldn't
say to you eight years ago.

Bye.

Message left at 12:02 p.m.

You idiot...

You're such an idiot...

All I could do was hide from Misato.

I knew there was nothing I could do.
Nothing I could say.

I was just a child.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

The silent phone...

WORKING
SORRY, DO NOT DISTURB

Ms. Misato's locked herself
in there all day again.

NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY
YOU COME IN, YOU DIE!

I wonder if Asuka is planning
to stay away again.

She won't go to school,
she won't go home...

She just sits there playing video games.

-Hikari?
-Yeah?

Let's go to bed.

Sure.

I'm sorry. I'm not being a bother, am I?

No, of course not.

I wasn't able to win, fighting in my Eva.

I'm not worth anything anymore.
Not to anyone.

I hate it. I hate it all.
I hate everybody.

But what I hate most of all is me.

It's like I just don't care anymore.

Asuka, I think you should do what
you want. I won't tell you what to do.

I mean, I think you did a great job.

Oh, the poor thing died?

Yes, probably. Cats don't live forever.

Don't cry, Grandma.

Sure. I'll come home for a visit
when I find the time.

Besides, it’s been three years
since I last visited Mom's grave.

I'll call you to let you know.

Okay, I have to go.

Oh. That cat died.

It's impossible for us to retrieve
the Spear of Longinus.

Why did you employ it?

The Eva series has not been completed
as per our plans yet.

I gave priority to the destruction
of the Angel. It was unavoidable.

"Unavoidable?" Your excuses need
to be a little more convincing.

Some of your recent actions
have crossed the line.

Fuyutsuki, we're in session.

Understood.

An Angel is currently approaching.
We will continue this later.

Assuming you are still
in command afterwards.

Ikari, do you intend to betray Seele?

I'll be there in 15.
Send Unit 00 to the surface using No.32.

Send out Unit 02 to provide support.

Yes, Commander Ikari
will have final say over Unit 01.

I don't have the authority
to lift its lockdown on my own. Later.

I have visual confirmation
of the Angel, at least...

Unit 00 away!
Routing to intercept position!

Have Unit 02 stand by at current position!

-No. Launch it.
-Commander?

Do it. At the very least,
it can serve as a decoy.

Yes, sir.

Eva-02, stand by for launch!

At the controls again,
acting like I deserve to be here.

I don't know when to give up, do I?

Routing Unit 02 to Gate No.8.
When egress point is determined, launch.

Hah. Won't I just get in the way
if I go out there?

Target closing.
Has crossed Goura Absolute Defense Line.

I just don't care anymore.

Target is holding above Owakudani.
It's hovering in position and rotating.

Target's A.T. Field is still active.

-Where have you been?
-I won't make excuses. Status?

Standoff situation is ongoing.

Pattern cycling between Blue and Orange!
It's changing at regular intervals!

-What does that mean?
-The Magi show "Analysis Failure."

So there's not enough data
to formulate an answer, huh?

That shape isn't a fixed form,
we can be sure of that.

So we can't make the first move.

Rei, we'll sit tight and see what it does.

No. It's coming.

Rei! Return fire!

Too late! There's not enough time!

Target in physical contact with Unit 00!

What about Unit 00's A.T. Field?

Deployed, but it's being
corroded by the Angel!

The Angel is trying to force
a first contact? With Unit 00?

She's in trouble! Unit 00's biological
components are being corrupted!

Eva-02, launch! Order her to
rescue Rei and provide cover!

Corruption by target is progressing!

This is dangerous. Over 5% of Unit 00
is now biologically melded.

Asuka, move up another 300,
then raise your A.T. Field to maximum

and fire your pallet gun
into the target's rear.

Got that? Eva-02, lift off!

Get out there! What's wrong, Asuka?

-Unit 02's status?
-No-go!

-Her synch rate is in the single digits!
-Asuka!

It won't move... It won't move!

She's a sitting duck up there!
Pull her back in, hurry!

Who's there? Me.

The me inside the Eva.

No. I sense someone else who isn't me.

Who are you?

An Angel?
One of the people we call Angels?

Won't you become one with me?

No. I'm me. I'm not you.

I see. But you can't stop it.
It's too late.

I'll share my heart with you.

I'll share my feelings with you.

You're in pain, aren't you?
There. Your heart is aching.

Aching? No, that's not it.

It's lonely.

Yes, that's it. It's lonely.

Lonely? I don't understand.

You don't want to be alone.

There are many of us.
But you're alone and you hate it.

That is what we call "loneliness."

That's your heart you're feeling.
It's yours that is full of sadness.

Your own heart.

These are tears!

The one that's crying... is me?

Rei!

The lockdown on Unit 01 is hereby lifted.

-Launch it immediately.
-Sir?

-Launch it.
-Yes, sir!

What the heck? They didn't send him out
when I was the one who needed help!

Deploy your A.T. Field! Rescue Rei! Hurry!

Yes, ma'am!

Shinji!

This is what my heart wants?
I want to be one with Shinji?

No!

Her A.T. Field is inverting!
Corruption spreading rapidly!

She's trying to contain the Angel?

Rei! Abandon the Eva! Get out of there!

I can't. Without me,
the A.T. Field will vanish.

So I can't go.

Rei, are you going to...

The core is collapsing!
It's gone critical!

Target eliminated.

This operation is hereby concluded.

-Stand down to condition one alert.
-Roger.

Stand down to condition
yellow immediately.

What's Unit 00's status?

No confirmation of entry plug ejection.

Begin search-and-rescue. Hurry.

Assuming there's anything to rescue.

Level C contamination zone
is spreading southwest.

Dr. Akagi.

I'm designating this as top secret.

Retrieve the plug.
Dispose of all associated parts.

Yes, ma'am.

Let's get to work, people!

With this, we have defeated all
of the Angels up through the 16th.

Only one of the Angels recorded in
Seele's Dead Sea Scrolls now remains.

The promised time is nearly upon us.

The road has been long,
and the sacrifices great.

Indeed. First we lost the Spear
of Longinus, and now Eva-00.

That is more than enough reason
to dismiss Ikari.

When we returned Fuyutsuki unharmed,
surely he understood our message.

This calls for another sacrificial lamb.
One that Ikari cannot dismiss.

We also require someone
to know the whole truth.

Shinji? I'm coming in.

Ms. Misato, the tears aren't coming.

I'm sad, but the tears just won't come.

Shinji, all I can do for you
right now is this.

Knock it off!

Don't, Ms. Misato.

I'm sorry.

He has to be feeling lonely...
Maybe he's scared of women.

No, what he's scared of
is intimacy with others.

Pen Pen, come here.

Oh, now I get it. Anybody will do.

I'm the one who was feeling lonely.

Hello? What did you say?!

Shinji!

Paging Dr. Ugai.
Dr. Ugai of Internal Medicine Dept.

Please contact
Conference Room 2 immediately.

Ayanami!

RADIODIAGNOSTICS, X-RAY CHECK-IN

Thank goodness you're alive, Ayanami.

Um... Father isn't here, huh?

Thanks for saving me.

From what?

What do you mean?
You sacrificed Unit 00 to save me.

Oh. I saved you.

Yeah. Don't you remember?

No. I don't know about it.

Because I think I'm probably
the third one.

AYANAMI

These are tears?

This should be the first time
I've seen them, but I feel like it isn't.

Am I... Am I crying?

Why am I crying?

That's right.
Maintain status quo on the First Children.

No new restrictions are necessary.

Same for the Second and Third.
Just keep them under surveillance.

Chairman Keel and the others will
raise heck when they learn Rei is alive.

I've sent the old men of Seele
something else to keep them occupied.

Not to worry.

We would prefer to proceed
in an amicable manner.

Subjecting you to further discomfort
or indignities is not our aim.

I beg your pardon,
but I'm not the least bit ashamed.

You're a strong-willed woman.

I can see why Ikari wants you at his side.

But the person who offered you up
to us was none other than...

Ikari himself.

He refused to allow
an interrogation of Unit 00's pilot,

and presented you as her proxy, Dr. Akagi.

So now I'm Rei's replacement?

WORKING
SORRY, BUT DO NOT DISTURB

This is part of the truth
that you've been looking for.

I've sent it using 36 other methods,
but those will probably never reach you.

This capsule is the only way
I know will work.

This is everything that I have.
Use it as you see fit.

The passcode is our first memory together.

Bye. Take care of yourself.

I'm through getting worked up
over a phone that won't ring.

Because I have your heart inside me now.

Did we make the right choice
regarding Dr. Akagi's treatment?

She is different from Fuyutsuki.
The prudent course is to return her.

The Eva series would not exist
without her. Let us use her a little more.

Indeed, for the future of humanity.

Evangelions... we will soon have
eight of them at our disposal.

Four more to go...

The obliteration of Tokyo-3
will do much to advance the project.

Put a rush on the rest.

Their completion will mark
the arrival of the promised day.

Hello?

Don't talk, just listen.

You're not under guard right now.
It's safe to leave.

Ms. Ritsuko?

That won't work. Not without my passcard.

I see. Courtesy of Ryoji?

You're going to let me see this place's
secrets with my own eyes.

That's fine. But he'll be coming with us.

All right.

This looks just like Ayanami's apartment.

It is Rei Ayanami's apartment.
This is where she was born and raised.

-It is?
-Yes. She was born here.

The imagery of this place
must be deeply ingrained

in the water and light
that make up Rei's deep psyche.

Dr. Akagi, this isn't what I came to see.

I know that, Misato.

An Eva?

The very first one. It was a failure.

Disposed of ten years ago.

An Eva graveyard...

It's just a dumping ground.

It's also the place
where your mother disappeared.

You may not remember, but I'm sure
you were watching when it happened.

The moment when your mother vanished.

Ritsuko!

Are you telling me that is where
the Dummy Plugs come from?

Let me show you the truth.

Rei... Ayanami!

Hang on, the Evas' Dummy Plugs are--

Yes. These form the core
of the Dummy System.

This is their production plant.

They're...

These are just empty dummies.
And simple spare parts for Rei.

Mankind stumbled across God.
Overjoyed, we tried to possess it.

And so, we were punished.
That happened 15 years ago.

The God we were so excited about vanished.

Undeterred, we then tried
to resurrect God.

That was Adam.

We made humans from Adam in God's image.

Those are the Evas.

They're people? They're human beings?

Yes. They're human.

The Evas are intrinsically soulless,
so we imbue them with one.

They're cobbled together
with salvaged material.

The only vessel that contained
a soul was Rei. Only her.

Only she was born with a soul.

The Chamber of Guf was completely empty.

None of these
Rei-shaped things has a soul.

They're just empty shells.

So I'm going to smash them.
Because I hate them.

Do you have any idea what you've done?!

Yes, I know. I've destroyed property.

These things aren't human.
They're human-shaped objects.

And I lost out even to those!
I wasn't good enough!

Simply thinking about him let me endure
any humiliation! Any outrage!

I don't care what happens to my body!

And yet, that man... He never...

Deep down, I knew.

I was a fool! All along!

Mother and daughter alike,
a matching pair of fools!

If you want to kill me, go ahead.

You would be doing me a favor.

It's that kind of thinking
that makes you a fool.

The tragedy of those
obsessed with the Evas...

Am I any different?

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

Mommy! Mommy! I've been chosen!

I'm gonna be an elite pilot
that protects humanity!

I'm the world's greatest!

It's supposed to be secret!
But I'll share it just with you, Mommy!

Lots of people are gonna be nice to me!
So I won't be lonely!

So I'll be fine even without Daddy!
I won't be lonely at all!

So look! Look at me!

Did you hear me, Mommy?

Synchronization rate, zero.
No longer qualified as Second Children.

There's no reason for me
to be here anymore.

Nobody will look at me.

Not Mom, not Dad, not anybody.

There's no reason for me to go on living.

Asuka Langley Soryu?

Intelligence Section 2 reports that
the Second Children is now in custody.

I see.

It's not like them to not only lose her,
but then take seven days to find her.

I bet it was intentional.
You know, to mess with us in Operations

Maybe.

And Asuka's replacement,
the Fifth, will arrive today.

The timing is way too convenient.

Rei Ayanami...

So that feeling I had was true?
Her seeming maternal.

Rei Ayanami and Mom...
What are you using them for...

Father?

Commander Ikari.

My cat died. My grandmother
had been looking after it for me.

I hadn't given it
a second thought in ages.

But now, suddenly,
I'll never see it again.

Why did you destroy the Dummy System?

I didn't destroy the dummies.
It was Rei that I destroyed.

I'll ask you again. Why?

Because having you make love to me
doesn't make me happy anymore.

Why don't you have your way with
my body? Just like you did before!

I'm disappointed in you.

"Disappointed"?!

You never had any hopes
or expectations for me in the first place!

You wanted nothing from me!
Nothing! Not a thing!

What should I do, Mother?

Where did you go, Asuka?

But even if I saw her, what then?
Talk to her about Ayanami?

Tohji and Kensuke...

Everybody left to find somewhere else
to live after losing their homes here.

There's nobody... There's nobody
here that I can call a friend now.

Nobody.

I can't even go see Ayanami.
I don't have the courage.

I don't know how I should treat her.

Asuka, Ms. Misato, Mom... What should I...

What should I do?

Aren't songs great?

Songs enrich the heart.

They're the crowning achievement
of Lilin culture.

Don't you think so...

Shinji Ikari?

-You know my name?
-Everybody knows you.

No offense, but I think you should
be more aware of your importance.

I should?

Um, who are you?

I'm Kaworu. Kaworu Nagisa.

Like you, I'm a child whose path has
been set out. I'm the Fifth Children.

You're the Fifth Children, uh... Nagisa?

Call me Kaworu, Ikari.

Um, call me Shinji, then.

I'm told that the Fifth Children
just arrived.

Kaworu Nagisa. All background
information has been deleted.

Just like Rei.

What we do know is that his date of birth
is the day of the Second Impact.

This boy was directly sent by the Council.
I'm sure there's more to him.

The report from the Marduk Institute
regarding the Fifth is being withheld.

I was curious, so I did a little hacking
into Intelligence's files.

Hey, that's seriously dangerous!

It was worth it.

I found out where Ms. Ritsuko is.

What do we do about
the Fifth's synchro tests?

Let's play it straight
and see what he can do.

For today, anyway.

-Try lowering it another 0.3.
-Yes, sir.

You're certain that
these readings are correct?

All monitoring systems
are operating properly.

No sign of any data errors
on the part of the Magi.

To think that this boy can synchronize
with Unit 02 without replacing its core.

It's astonishing.

Sir, I just can't believe it!

I mean, it's fundamentally impossible
on a system level.

And yet it's a fact.

First you accept the facts,

then you try to explain them.

So you're the First Children?

Rei Ayanami.

You're just like me, I see.

Who are you?

I'm told that the Fifth
has made contact with Rei.

I see.

The Magi are going all-out,
sifting through his data.

In spite of that, his true nature
remains a mystery.

Who in the world is that boy?

NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

Shinji hasn't come home yet, either.

Some guardian I am.

The Central Dogma is currently closed.
Please use Route 3 for transit.

Hello. Were you waiting for me?

Uh, no. Not really. I wasn't trying to--

Have plans today?

Well, our regular testing is over.

So all that's left is to take a shower
and go home.

But to be honest, I don't really
want to go home these days.

Having a home,
a house to return to, leads to happiness.

-That's a good thing.
-It is?

I want to talk to you some more.
Mind if I go with you?

To the showers.
Isn't that where you were going?

-Uh, yeah.
-You don't want me to come?

It's just... Um, you can come if you want.

You certainly go to extremes
to avoid making first contact.

Are you afraid of intimacy with others?

If you avoid other people,
you'll never be betrayed.

You won't hurt each other, either.

But you'll also never stop feeling lonely.

Humans can't permanently
be free of loneliness.

Because man is ultimately alone.

But people can go on living

because they're able to forget.

Closing time.

Already?

Yeah. We'd better get to bed.

Together?

No! I think they've set up
an apartment for you, Kaworu.

A separate one.

Oh.

The human heart is in constant pain.

The heart is sensitive to pain,
so that makes living feel painful.

Hearts are as delicate as glass.
Especially yours.

-It is?
-Yes. You're worthy of my grace.

Your grace?

It means I like you.

Nerv, the organization founded
to be Seele's execution agency.

It was put in place
to carry out our scenario.

But the agency has become
the personal plaything of one man.

Indeed. We must reclaim it.

Before the promised day comes.

We must return Nerv
and the Eva Series to their original form.

Ikari, you will be held to account
for your breach of Seele's trust.

The time we were allotted is running out.

But the Spear of Longinus, which stood
in the way of our dream, is now gone.

The final Angel will soon appear.

Once it's destroyed,
that dream will be fulfilled.

It won't be long now, Yui.

Why am I here?

Why am I alive again?

For what?

For who?

The Fifth Children...

I sense that he's the same as me.

But why?

Good thing we're in the suburbs.

You didn't get caught in the blast.

But next time, we might be so lucky.

So the Horakis are gonna look after you
starting tomorrow, okay?

We're gonna have to say goodbye
for a while, Pen Pen.

I insist, let me sleep on the floor.

No, that's okay. I was the one
who asked if I could stay over.

I'm fine down here.

What do you want to talk about?

There's something that you want
to get off your chest, right?

I've been through so much
since I got here.

Before this, I was staying with a teacher.

Days there were quiet and uneventful.

All I did was take up space.

But that was fine with me.
There was nothing that I wanted to do.

You hate being around other people?

Not exactly.
I don't think I cared either way.

But I did hate my father.

Why am I talking to Kaworu
about this stuff?

You know, I might have been born
so that I could meet you.

So... Did you manage to get his files?

Here. I "borrowed" this from
Lt. Ibuki without her knowing.

I'm sorry, I keep asking you
to sneak around like a thief.

What the heck?

It's no surprise that Maya
can't show this to anyone!

It's theoretically impossible!

Yeah... The mysteries around this kid
just keep getting deeper.

He can set his synch rate
with an Eva to whatever he wants?

And do it at will?

I guess I have to resort to
extreme measures again...

I'm surprised to see you.

I need to ask you something.

Anything you say in here will be recorded.

I don't care.

That boy, the Fifth...
Who is he? What is he?

He's probably the final messenger.

Let's go. Come along, alter ego
of Adam and servant of the Lilin.

ALERT

Eva-02 has activated!

It's what?! Where's Asuka?!

In hospital room 303! I have confirmation!

-Then who's at the controls?!
-It's unmanned!

Unit 02 doesn't have
an entry plug inserted!

It's unmanned?
Then the Fifth isn't doing this?

A.T. Field generation detected
in the Central Dogma!

-Is it Unit 02?
-Negative! Pattern Blue!

-No doubt about it, it's an Angel!
-It's what?!

That boy... He's an Angel?

Target passing Level 4! Still descending!

It's no use!
Unable to cut power to the maglev!

Target passing Level 5!

All Central Dogma blast doors,
emergency lockdown!

Buy us some time. I don't care how much.

Emergency lockdown of all
Malebolge levels! All personnel, evacuate!

All personnel, evacuate!

I can't believe Seele would
send one directly at us...

The old men are trying to skip a step.
Using us to do it.

The final Angel has penetrated
the Central Dogma.

It is now descending.

Exactly as planned.

Ikari, you were a good friend
who shared our goal,

as well as a collaborator
of great insight.

This is your final task.

Let us hope Unit 01
will carry out the task.

Eva-02 is breaching the armored bulkheads!

Target has passed Cocytus No.2!

-Have Eva-01 pursue.
-Yes, sir!

Use any means necessary
to prevent the target

from entering the Terminal Dogma.

But why did the Angel take Unit 02?

Does it intend to merge
with Unit 02, perhaps?

Or to bring about our destruction.

It's a lie! A lie! A lie!

Kaworu's a... He's an Angel?!

That's not true!

Facts are facts. Just accept it.

You need to launch. Ready?

What's keeping you, Shinji?

Eva-01 descending Route 2!
In pursuit of target!

You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings!

You betrayed me, just like Father!

Eva-01 has arrived at Level 4.
About to make contact with target.

There he is!

I've been waiting for you, Shinji.

Kaworu!

Asuka, I'm sorry!

The Eva Series...

Creatures born of Adam which are
abominations in the eyes of humanity.

The Lilin resort to using even
such things in order to survive.

This is most perplexing.

Kaworu! Stop it! Why are you doing this?!

The Evas and I are made of the same flesh.

We are both born of Adam, you see.

If it weren't for its soul,
I could merge with it.

Especially since Unit 02 here
is closing off its own soul right now.

An A.T. Field!

Oh, right. That's what you Lilin call it.

That sacred region which none may violate.
The light of the heart.

Deep down, you Lilin must know.

The A.T. Field is the inner wall
that we all possess.

How would I know that, Kaworu?!

-Both Evas have reached lowest level.
-Target will reach Terminal Dogma in 20.

If we lose Eva-01's signal
and detect another change...

I know, ma'am.
I'll trigger the self-destruct.

It's better than letting
the Third Impact happen.

I'm sorry.

I don't mind dying. Not if it's with you.

Thanks.

Humanity's fate...

Man's hope is lined with sorrow.

What was that?!

The most powerful A.T. Field
we've ever recorded!

Light, EM waves, and subatomic
particles are all being blocked!

-Unable to monitor situation!
-It's a d*** containment field.

The target and Eva 01
and Eva 02 are off our scopes!

Unable to contact pilot!

Kaworu!

Come back!

Final safety device disengaged!

Heaven's Door is opening!

So an Angel finally made it.

Hyuga.

What's that?!

-Status?
-It's an A.T. Field!

A field of equal power is being generated
near the earlier Terminal Dogma field!

It's breaking through
the containment field!

What? A new Angel?

Unknown! Unable to verify!

Wait, it's gone!

It's gone? The Angel vanished?!

Adam, mother figure to my kind.

Must those born of Adam return to him?

Even if that means dooming humanity?

Wait, this isn't...

It's Lilith!

I see... So that's your plan, Lilin!

Thank you, Shinji.

I had hoped that you would
stop Unit 02 for me.

Otherwise, I may have been
able to live on alongside her.

Kaworu, why are you...

It's my fate. It dictates that I live on.

Even if mankind perishes as a result.

But I can die here if I want.
Life and death hold equal value to me.

Choosing to die is
the one absolute freedom.

What's that mean? Kaworu,
I don't understand what you're saying!

They're my last words.

Now, go ahead and destroy me.

If you don't,
you and your kind will disappear.

Only one lifeform can avoid extinction
and be granted a future.

And you aren't someone who ought to die.

Your kind needs a future.

Thank you.

I'm happy that I met you.

Kaworu said I was... worthy of his grace.
That he liked me.

That's the first time anybody's
ever said they liked me. Ever.

He was similar to me. And to Ayanami.

I really liked him.

If only one of us could survive,
it should have been him.

He was a way better person than I am.

Kaworu should have survived!

You're wrong. Only those with
the will to live get to survive.

He craved death.

He abandoned his will to live
and clung to a false hope.

You didn't do anything wrong, Shinji.

That's really cold, Ms. Misato.

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

RAISON D'ÊTRE,ONE'S REASON FOR BEING

THE REASON IT'S OKAY TO BE HERE

THE CASE OF SHINJI IKARI

A BOY WISHED FOR HIS OWN DEATH

A BOY GRANTED HIS WISH

THE FINAL ANGEL IS GONE

YET SHINJI IKARI AGONIZES OVER IT

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

I didn't have any choice!

WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

Because Kaworu was... He was an Angel!

WASN'T HE AS HUMAN AS YOU ARE?

No! He was an Angel! Our enemy!

WASN'T HE AS HUMAN AS YOU ARE?

No! No! He wasn't!

But he was a person just like me.

No! He was an Angel!

So you killed him?

That's right! If I hadn't,
we all would have died!

Everyone would have died!

So you killed him?

I didn't want to do it!
But there was no other way!

SO YOU KILLED HIM

Help me...

SO YOU KILLED HIM

Help me...

SO YOU KILLED HIM

Help me!

SO YOU KILLED HIM

Somebody, help me!

SO YOU KILLED HIM

I'm begging you! Somebody, please help me!

Yeah, if only one of us could survive,
it should have been him.

He was a way better person than I am.

Kaworu should have survived!

You're wrong. Only those with
the will to live get to survive.

He craved death.

He abandoned his will to live
and clung to a false hope.

You didn't do anything wrong, Shinji.

Really?

Did I really do the right thing?

I don't know. What should I do?

What should I do?

WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

Afraid?

WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

Myself?

WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

Being rejected.

By who? Who?

I'm afraid... of Father!

I was abandoned by Father. He hated me.

What will I do if people hate me?
What should I do then?

What is this place?

Where should I go?

I can't see anything.
I can't make anything out.

Ms. Misato?

Ms. Misato!

Hey! Where did you go, Ms. Misato?

Hey! Where should I go from here?

Ms. Misato! Asuka! Ayanami!

Tohji! Kensuke! Ms. Ritsuko!

Mr. Kaji!

Father!

Mother...

Somebody, tell me...

Please, tell me what I should do!

Evangelion Unit 01...

In the end, is piloting this all I have?

Am I supposed to pilot this again
like Father and everybody else says?

Even if it means killing people I like?

Mother! Say something! Answer me!

WHY DO YOU PILOT THE EVA?

Because people tell me to.

THAT'S WHY YOU PILOT THE EVA?

To... To help everyone!
What's wrong with that?

YOU PILOT THE EVA TO HELP EVERYONE?
TO HELP OTHERS?

That's right! That's a great thing!

It's a really great thing!

Everybody praises me when I do!
Everybody takes care of me!

That's a lie.

What are you, an idiot? That means
you're actually doing it for yourself.

There you go again, making excuses
to yourself right off the bat.

I am?

The mindset that you're
doing your best to serve others,

that's a cop-out right there!

It is?

What it boils down to
is that you're lonely, Shinji.

I am?

That's just dependency!
A symbiotic relationship!

Maybe that's true...

You're just hoping that
you'll be needed by others!

Maybe that's true...

You're just sitting around, waiting for
someone to bring happiness to you!

To bring you false happiness.

But don't you do the same thing?

OUR SECOND CHARACTER

THE CASE OF ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU

I don't remember getting in,
but I'm back in the Eva.

Forced back into it.

It's not like this busted
piece of junk even works.

No, I guess I'm
the busted piece of junk...

They don't want me.

Nobody would ever want me!

Nobody needs a pilot
who can't operate an Eva!

You're looking to others
to define yourself.

Shut up!

SEPARATION ANXIETY

You're afraid of being alone, aren't you?

You're afraid that if everyone else
goes away, so will you.

That's why you pilot your Eva.

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

I don't want to hear that crap,
not from a doll like you!

OUR THIRD CHARACTER

THE CASE OF REI AYANAMI

Who am I?

Rei Ayanami.

But who... are you?

REI AYANAMI

You're also Rei Ayanami?

Yes. I'm an object
that's called Rei Ayanami.

We're all objects that
are called Rei Ayanami.

Why are all of you me?

Because other people
all call us Rei Ayanami.

Why do you have a heart and body
that are forgeries?

They aren't forgeries. Because I'm me.

No. You're a person whose fake soul

was created by a human named Gendoh Ikari.

You're nothing but a fake object
that is pretending to be a human being.

See that? Inside of you is a heart

that's a dark, impenetrable,
unfathomable abyss.

The real you is in there.

I am the real me.

I became myself
over the time that I've existed

and through the connections
that I've formed with others.

The person I am is shaped by
my interactions with others.

Interactions with others
and the passage of time

will change the shape of my heart.

THOSE ARE LINKS?

Yes. Those are what created
the person that I have been,

the object called Rei Ayanami.

They will create the person I will be.

THOSE ARE LINKS

But there's another, real you.

You just don't know it.

You don't want to see her, so you just
keep avoiding her subconsciously.

BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

Because she might not be human in shape.

Because the person you have been
up until now might disappear.

YOU'RE AFRAID

You're afraid that who you are
will vanish.

You're afraid that you'll disappear
from everyone's hearts.

Afraid? Why would I be afraid?

Your own personal world
would disappear, too.

ISN'T THAT SCARY?

It means you would disappear.

ISN'T THAT SCARY?

No, that would make me happy.
I want to die.

What I want is despair.
I want to return to nothingness.

But I can't.
I can't return to nothingness.

He won't let me go back.

He won't let me go, not yet.

I came into existence because he needs me.

But it's over now.
I won't be needed anymore.

I'll be abandoned by him.

I had always longed for that day,
but now I'm afraid.

Let's go.

This is the day

you were born for, Rei.

Yes, sir.

AND...

THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF HUMANITY BEGINS

BACK TO SHINJI IKARI

What's this sensation?

I think I've felt it before.

Like the lines of my body
are melting away.

It feels nice...

It's like I'm getting bigger,
spreading out.

Forever... and ever...

THIS WAS HOW EVERYONE'S
INSTRUMENTALITY BEGAN

PARTS THEY WERE MISSING

HEARTS THEY HAD LOST

THAT EMPTINESS IN THEIR HEARTS WAS FILLED

THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF
THE HEART, THE SOUL, BEGINS

EVERYONE'S INSTRUMENTALITY BEGINS,

RETURNING EVERYTHING TO NOTHINGNESS

No, we aren't returning to nothingness.

I'm simply returning everything
to its beginning.

Returning to the mother
who has been lost to this world.

Our hearts will become one,
and we will achieve eternal peace.

That's all this is, nothing more.

That's the Instrumentality Project?

Yes. We all have a part of our heart
that is forever empty.

Something we have lost.

THIS CAUSES EMOTIONAL STARVATION

THIS CAUSES EMOTIONAL ANXIETY AND FEAR

We all fear that darkness within us,

and we live our lives
trying to escape it or banish it.

As long as there are people,
that darkness will never disappear.

So you think we should merge
everyone's hearts together

to get them to make each other whole?

And without anyone's consent?!
What gives you the right?!

That's just forcing people
to cozy up to each other!

But you yourself
always wanted the same thing.

Where am I?

THE CASE OF MISATO KATSURAGI
(PART 1)

This is my heart inside
your heart, Ms. Misato.

And at the same, it's also my heart
inside your heart, Shinji.

For me to find myself, I need to interact
with lots of different people.

I need to take a good look inside myself.

I need to take a good look at
the Ms. Misato that's inside me.

Ms. Misato, what do you wish for?

DO YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD GIRL?

I need to be a good girl.

WHY?

Because Daddy is always gone.

I need to be a good girl and help Mommy.

But I don't want to end up like Mommy.

Because Mommy is always crying
when Daddy is away.

I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't act spoiled.

That's why I need to be a good girl.

And I'll make sure that
Daddy won't hate me.

But I hate my father.
That's why I hate being a good girl.

I hate it... I'm so tired.

Tired of keeping myself
all clean and pretty.

Tired of the me that keeps up
the charade of being clean and pretty.

I'm exhausted.

I want to get sullied.

I wanted to see myself absolutely filthy.

That's why you slept with him?

No, I loved him.
That's why I slept with him.

Were you really in love with him?

Yes, that's right.
He accepted me for who I am.

ARE YOU SURE?

He was gentle with me!

No! Please! Don't show that to Shinji!

It's nothing to get
embarrassed about at this point.

It's embarrassing!

Why is it embarrassing?

You were fine with it
in front of the man you loved.

In fact, you loved
parading around off like this.

No! Stop!

The truth is, you actually love
letting Shinji see you like this.

That's a lie! You're wrong! Wrong!

Really, now?

It's really your father
that you want to show this to.

You're wrong!

You tried to find solace
in Ryoji's face as he slept.

You're wrong!

You tried to find solace
in the warmth of Ryoji's body.

You're wrong!

You tried to find your father
in Ryoji's arms.

You're wrong!

It's true.

I recognized my father in Ryoji back then.

That's why I ran away from him.

I was afraid.
It was like my father and I were...

But the truth is,
I ran away because I was happy.

It felt so good.

Those were moments of utter bliss.

That's why I hated it.

That's why I broke up with him.

I guess they're right.
"You never have a reason to fall in love,

but you always have a reason
to fall out of love."

You're kind, Ryoji.

Use that kindness... I'm begging you.

Make me filthy.

Don't try to hurt yourself just because
you hate who you are at this moment.

That's just using momentary punishment
to distract yourself.

You really don't want to do that.

You're saying that I should
take care of myself, huh?

Men are all like that.

They get lost in their work,
in their own little worlds.

And leave me behind.

That's exactly what Father did.

They're always running away
from a harsh reality.

Harsh reality?

Meaning me, right?

It must be. Just look at me.
Could anybody blame him?

Knock it off, Ms. Misato!

I can't live with myself sometimes!
I hate myself!

How indecent. That's filthy.

How appalling.

That's so smutty! So absolutely gross!

This is what an adult relationship
is like?! I'm gonna puke!

Congratulations on your promotion,
Major Katsuragi.

The me that's respected is a character
that I play to try to earn respect.

That's not the real me.

The real you is always crying.

No, I'm happy.

AM I HAPPY?

I'm happy.

AM I HAPPY?

I'm happy!

AM I HAPPY?

I'm not! This isn't happiness!

WHAT IS HAPPINESS?

This isn't the real me!

I just try to convince myself that it is!

We can't go through life
unless we do that?

We get scared if we're not with others.

We get anxious.

If someone isn't sleeping next to us.

You're scared of sleeping alone?

So sleeping by yourself
makes you feel lonely?

You can't stand the hole in your heart.

That's why you don't care who it's with.

You're wrong!

No, you just want to experience
simple pleasures.

You want to soothe your suffering heart
with those momentary escapes.

You're just using men
as a means to that end.

You're wrong! You're wrong! You're wrong!

WHAT COULD SHE BE WISHING FOR?

Where am I?

This is my heart inside your heart, Asuka.

And at the same, it's also my heart
inside your heart, Shinji.

THE CASE OF ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU
(PART 1)

Asuka, what do you wish for?

I'll live on my own.

I don't need Mommy or Daddy.
I'll live on my own.

I won't cry anymore.

But I'm still crying...

Why am I crying?

I honestly don't know
how to deal with her.

It's not like a doctor
to sound so unsure of herself.

A doctor is also a human being.
As I've told you before.

Still, it's hard to believe that a woman
like you could be rattled by a child.

She's strangely mature.

So tightly wound
and absolutely unapproachable.

She scares me sometimes.
Have you ever sensed that about her?

Not really.
Anyway, you're Asuka's mother now.

I became your wife
before I became her mother.

-It was at the same time.
-Yes, in terms of societal roles.

But while you can never
stop being her father,

I can stop being her mother
whenever I like.

I suppose that's true.

Don't, Mommy! Don't stop being my Mommy!

I'll be a good girl that you'll love!

So don't stop being my Mommy!

So please look at me!

Don't, Mommy! Please don't kill me!

Daddy hates Mommy now.

He doesn't need me anymore.

No, he never loved me in the first place.

He never really needed me
at all, I know it.

So die with Mommy, all right?

Because Daddy doesn't want us.

Am I a nuisance? Am I unwanted?

Die with me...

No! I'm not your doll, Mommy!

I'll think for myself and live for myself!

When I found her,
Mom was hanging from the ceiling.

She had such a happy look on her face.

But I hated that look on her face so much.

I don't want to die. I don't want
to fade away and disappear.

I don't want boys, either!
And I don't want Dad or Mom!

I don't want anyone!

No one will protect me!

No one will be with me!

WHAT DOES SHE WISH FOR?

So I'll live for myself!

But I hate it! It's hard!

I don't want to be alone!

Don't abandon me.

Don't cast me aside.

Don't kill me.

What is this?

What your father was working on.
The Human Instrumentality Project.

-That's what this is?
-Part of it, looks like.

The truth is something
we never really know.

What you experience
at any given time are mere facts.

Your own set of facts.

And memory of those facts
gradually become your reality.

Some truths change
and transform over time.

This is a fact?
This is how everything turns out?

There are lots of facts. This is just one.

This is the outcome you wished for.

I wished for this?

That's right. For destruction.
A world where no one is saved.

No! It's a world where nobody
saved me! That's all.

No one can save you.

This is what you wished for.

Destruction. Death.
A return to nothingness.

These are things you wished for.

This is reality.

What is reality?

The world around you.

Your own world, one that exists alongside
time and space and other people.

A world where you yourself choose
how to interpret and accept things.

Right now, it's a world made up of
only what was given to you.

THAT IS REALITY

A world of your own
that you have no control over.

You mean a world where everything
is decided for me, right?!

No, it's not. It's a world
where you make the decisions.

It is a world where your heart
decides how things will be.

THAT IS REALITY

The will to go on living.

A heart that wanted to die.

Those are things that
you yourself wished for.

This darkness and this strange world...
You're saying that I wished for this?

That's right.

You wished for a closed-off world
that's comfortable for you and only you.

To protect your fragile heart.

To protect your pleasure.

This is just the natural outcome.

People can't live in a closed-off realm.
In a world all their own.

But you wished for the world, for
the world around you, to be closed off.

Driving away everything you dislike,
you wished for a lonely world.

Your own heart did this.

It culminated in this tiny world
of peace of mind for you alone.

The shape it's taken here
is one possible ending.

This is the end of the world
that you yourself brought about.

AND SO, THE QUEST FOR INSTRUMENTALITY

CONTINUES

Endings. They can always
be found after a beginning.

Will our wishes lead to our destruction?

Is our hope death itself?

Like a cruel angel

Become a legend, young boy

When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart

You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently

So eager for something
You touch so softly

Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits

But one day, you will realize
That upon your back

You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future

The cruel angel's thesis

One day, you'll take off through a window

If your overflowing pathos

Leads you to betray your memories

Then embrace the heavens and shine bright

Become legend, young boy

IN THE YEAR 2016 A.D.

THE INSTRUMENTALITY

OF WHAT PEOPLE HAD LOST, THAT IS,
OF THE HEART, WAS UNDERWAY

HOWEVER, IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO LONG
TO DEPICT ALL SUCH EVENTS

WE WILL THEREFORE FOCUS ON
THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF

THE HEART BELONGING
TO THE BOY SHINJI IKARI

THE CASE OF SHINJI IKARI

TERROR

Terror that I'll disappear.

But I also feel like it would be fine
if someone like me disappeared.

Why's that?

Because I'm a human being
that nobody wants.

I knew it, I'm an unwanted child.

I don't matter at all!

You're running away by thinking
you don't matter, aren't you?

You're afraid of failing, aren't you?

You're afraid of being hated, aren't you?

You're afraid to look at
your weak self, aren't you?

But you do exactly
the same thing, Ms. Misato!

That's right. We're all like that.

Something inside our hearts is missing.

-It terrifies us.
-It makes us anxious.

That's why we're trying
to merge into one now.

We're trying to make each other whole.

That's what
the Instrumentality Project does.

People can't survive unless
they're part of a group.

People cannot live all on their own.

Even though, in the end, we are all alone.

That's why life is painful.

That's why life is lonely.

That's what drives us to embrace
another heart, another body.

We want to become one.

Man is made of weak, fragile stuff.

Our hearts and bodies
are made of weak, fragile stuff.

So we must make each other whole
using instrumentality.

WHY?

Because if we don't,
we won't be able to survive.

IS THAT TRUE?

Why are you alive?

I DON'T KNOW.

Because I want to find out why, I guess.

Who do you live for?

For myself, of course.

Probably for myself.

IS THAT TRUE?

Are you happy to be alive?

I don't know.

Are you happy to be alive?

Of course I'm happy!

Are you happy to be alive?

I only want to do things that I enjoy.

Do you hate being lonely?

I don't like it.

You don't like being hurt?

I don't like it.

That's why you run away?

That's right. What's wrong with
running away from hurt and pain?!

Don't run away.

Why shouldn't you run away?

It hurts when you run away.

Even though you ran away
from painful things?

It was painful!

If you've figured out what's painful,
that's a win, right?

Right. If something is painful,
it's okay to run away.

If you really don't want to do something,
it's okay to run away.

But I don't want to! I'm sick of running!

Right... I shouldn't run away.

That's because you sense that running
away will only bring even more pain.

You learned how much it hurts to run.

That's why you don't want
to run away, isn't it?

Well, if I run away,
no one will talk to me anymore.

Don't abandon me!
I'm begging you, don't abandon me!

He does whatever he's told.
That's how he makes his life easier.

That's right! If I don't,
I'll be abandoned again.

You're afraid that you'll
be hurt, aren't you?

You've just gotten that
into your head, haven't you?

You're not the only one
who gets hurt, Shinji.

You think you're the only one
with problems?

You just think that way because
it makes things easier for you.

Shut up! That has nothing to do with this!

I don't matter to anyone or anything!

There you go again,
denying your own worth right off the bat.

Because I don't have any.

There you go again,
telling yourself that you're worthless!

If you think that way and do nothing,
you won't be hurt.

You keep yourself going
by being praised by others!

Nobody accepts me...

You just tell yourself that, that's all.

That's why I need to pilot the Eva.

You just convinced yourself that you've
never had any worth from the very get-go!

But I have to do that!

That's not true.

You just tell yourself that, man!

No. I'm worthless.
I don't have anything to be proud of.

That's why I pilot the Eva!

Piloting the Eva lets me stay who I am.

Piloting the Eva lets me stay who I am.

Before I piloted my Eva,
there was nothing special about me.

I can only stay here
because I pilot my Eva!

Because I don't have anything else!

Because I don't have anything else.

I don't have anything. Nothing at all.

MY LIFE'S VALUE

Is zero.

THAT'S WHY

I hate myself.

I hate you! I hate you! I hate your guts!

I can't freaking stand you!

I hate you, man.

I'm sorry, but I hate you.

I hate you.

I hate you.

I hate you.

I hate you. So very much.

I hate you, you know that?

I can't stand you!

See? That's what everybody thinks.

I'm sure they're thinking that!

Aren't you just convincing
yourself that they do?

No! I know they are,
because I even hate myself!

So you assume that
everyone else does, too.

I hate you! I hate you! I hate your guts!

But they praise me!

When I pilot the Eva, they praise me!

People praised me!

THAT MAKES ME HAPPY

They praised me!

BUT I'M NOT HAPPY

Which one is how you really feel?

I don't know.

No, they're both how I really feel.

So that's why you pilot the Eva.

Because all I have right now is the Eva.

You have no identity outside of
being a pilot, do you?

It's true, Eva-01 is a part of your heart.

But if you become dependent on it,
the Eva will dictate who you are.

Your identity will be defined
entirely in terms of the Eva.

Who you really are
will fade away and disappear.

That's fine! I never had
anything else to begin with!

I mean, all that cello practice
didn't lead to anything.

You never did anything
on your own initiative, that's all!

But right now, I can pilot an Eva!

Before long, you'll find yourself being
unable to do anything without it.

Just like me.

WHY DO YOU PILOT THE EVA?

Because that's all there is to me.

Rain.

A melancholy feeling.
Just like how I feel right now.

I don't like it.

The setting sun.

Fading life. I wish for that.

I don't like it.

Morning.

The beginning of today.
The beginning of an awful day.

I don't like it.

A blue sky.

Something that's warm.
Something that's unfamiliar.

Something that scares me.
Something I don't want.

I don't like it.

I hate everybody! I hate you all!

What do you wish for?

YOU'RE AFRAID OF ANXIETY?

What do you want?

YOU WANT SOLACE?

What are you looking for?

Don't hate me!

I'm afraid of...

REJECTION

What I want is...

CONTACT AND ACCEPTANCE

Is it okay for me to stay next to you?

It is okay for me to be here?

Do you love me?

DO YOU LOVE

YOUR MOTHER?

Do you want to go see Mommy?

I don't want to go.

Aren't you going to go see Father?

I don't want to go.

Why not?

I'M AFRAID

Because I'm afraid of being hated.

Because I might cease to exist.

THAT'S WHY?

What do you wish for?

RELIEF FROM ANXIETY

What are you looking for?

RELIEF FROM LONELINESS

You aren't wishing for happiness?

Before I can be happy, I want something.

I want to be valuable!

So valuable that no one will abandon me,
and everyone will take care of me!

I WANT VALUE

That's something
that only you can give yourself.

Your own worth.

SO I PILOT THE EVA

I have no worth.

I'm not valuable enough to go on living.

What are you, then?

What am I, then?

What the heck am I?!

This... it's me!

The shape that I show to others.

The symbol for me.

So is this, and this, and this!

They're all just things that represent me!

Nothing but things
that let people recognize me!

What am I, then?

WHERE AM I?

This is me. The real me?

The false me?

You are you.

But there is a boundary between you
and the scope of what it means to be you.

That's right!

My clothes. My shoes.

My room.

They're all elements of who I am.

They're all things that are connected
to your consciousness.

The thing I perceive to be myself is me.

In the end, am I nothing but myself?

But I don't know who I am.

Where am I?

What am I?

What the heck am I?

AND SO, YOU WISH TO
CLOSE OFF YOUR HEART

Nobody understands me!

Are you stupid or something?!
Of course they don't!

Nobody can possibly understand you!

The only person who can console you
and truly understand you

is you yourself.

So you need to take care of yourself.

You say that, but there's no real me!

I don't understand myself!

So how can I take care of myself?!

YOU'RE ANXIOUS

I can see that you're anxious.

About who you are now.

About the people around you.

About the environment that surrounds you.

But none of those things last forever.

Time is endlessly flowing onwards.

Your world is made up of
continuous change.

Most importantly,
the world can change at any moment

based on what you're feeling.

What's this?

A blank world? A world with no one in it?

A world of freedom!

Freedom?

A world of freedom
where there is nothing to restrain you.

This is freedom?

That's right. A free world.

But that means it is completely empty.

Unless I think of something?

Yes. Unless you think of something.

But that's...
I don't know what I should do!

-It makes you uneasy, doesn't it?
-You can't visualize yourself.

It's all too vague.

It's a world that's completely undefined.

THAT IS FREEDOM

It's a world where you can do anything.

But you're filled with anxiety.

You don't know what to do, is that it?

What should I do?

I'll give you a constraint.

There. Now you have up and down.

But you've lost one degree of freedom.

You have to stand on the ground now.

But you feel safer.

Because your heart feels
a little more at ease.

So you try walking.

You're willing this to happen.

Me? I'm willing this?

This world where the ground exists
is the world around you.

But the thing is, you can still
move around however you want.

If you wanted to, you could change
the orientation of the world.

And at the same time, the orientation
of the world isn't constant.

It changes along with the passage of time.

You yourself are also capable of changing.

Because what gives you shape is your
own heart and the world around you.

After all, this is your world.

This is the shape of reality
as perceived by you.

THAT IS REALITY

This... is an empty space.

A world that's empty.

A world that's empty of everything but me.

I'm starting to become indistinct.

I feel myself disappearing.

The being that is me is fading away.

"WHY?"

That's because no one is here but you.

Because I'm alone.

If nothing exists outside of yourself,
you can't determine your own shape.

My own shape...

MY SELF IMAGE?

Yes. You learn your own shape
by observing the shapes of others.

You visualize your own shape by seeing
the wall between "self" and "other".

You can't see yourself
unless others are there with you.

But that means it's other people
that let me be myself!

If a person is alone,
they're alone no matter where they go!

The whole world is just me!

You take shape through recognizing
how you are different from others.

The first "other" is your mother.

Your mother is a person who is not you.

Right... I'm me.

But at the same time, it's true that other
people make up parts of my heart!

That's right, Shinji Ikari.

So you finally figured it out?

Idiot Shinji!

So you're finally awake, Idiot Shinji?

Oh, it's just you, Asuka...

What do you mean "just me"?!

I come over every morning to wake you
so you won't be late for school!

Is that how you thank
your childhood friend?

Sure, thanks...

So just let me sleep
a little while longer...

Don't be such a slacker!

Get your butt out of bed this instant!

Pervert! Jerk! Sleazebag!
I can't believe you!

I can't help it! It's morning!

Honestly, that Shinji...

Asuka is so thoughtful,
coming over every morning.

He should show some appreciation.

Mm.

And you! Put down that paper
and get ready for work!

Mm.

For Heaven's sake, you're a grown man,
and you're no different from Shinji!

Are you ready to go?

Yes, I'm waiting on you.

Look, I'm the one that Prof. Fuyutsuki
scolds when we're late for meetings!

Because you're so irresistible.

Enough with the nonsense! Go get changed!

Mm.

Whatever you say, Yui.

Come on, hurry it up!

Okay, okay!
Geez, you're such a nag, Asuka!

What did you call me?!

Okay, Mrs. Ikari! We're off to school!

See you tonight, Mom.

Sure! Have a nice day at school!

Honey! Get your nose
out of that newspaper!

Mm. Whatever you say, Yui.

They say another transfer student
is starting today!

No surprise!

This city's gonna be the new capital
starting next year, after all.

More and more people will be coming.

I guess you're right.

I wonder what she'll be like.
I hope she's cute!

I'm late, I'm late!

I'll be in the doghouse forever
if I'm late on my first day!

Ow!

Ow...

Sorry! I was in a big hurry!

Honest, I'm real sorry!

What?! So you got a look at
this chick's panties?!

It wasn't really a look.
More of a glimpse.

The day's just started,
and you're lucking out already!

Ow!

What's the big idea, Class Rep?

Suzuhara! The day's just started,
and you're already spouting garbage!

Go change the water in the vase!
You're on duty this week, remember?

-Geez, you're such a nag!
-What did you call me?!

Tohji's totally the type
who's gonna be whipped.

Like you're any different.

What makes you say
I'm the type who will be whipped?

All I did was lay out the truth.

-Come on, why?
-Have you looked in the mirror?!

You're always like this, Asuka!

Ah... Life is peaceful.

It's Miss Misato!

Man, is Miss Misato a babe or what?

Just look at the Idiot Trio!
They act like idiots!

All rise! Bow!

Be seated!

Rejoice, boy students!

Here is the new transfer student
everyone's been talking about!

I'm Rei Ayanami! Nice to meet you!

You! You're that panty peeper
from this morning!

Hey! Enough with the false accusations!
You deliberately gave Shinji a peep show!

What's your deal?
How come you're jumping to his defense?

You two an item or something?

We're childhood friends, that's all!
You're got a big mouth, you know that?

Hey, class has started! Be quiet!

Actually, this looks like fun!
I want to see how this plays out!

Feel free to continue!

I get it, this is another possible world.

A possibility that's inside me.

The me that I am now
isn't the entirety of what I am.

Different versions of me might exist.

Oh, right! There could even be
a me that isn't an Eva pilot!

If you think of it that way,
this real world isn't such a bad place.

The real world might not be so bad.
But I do hate myself.

It's your heart that perceives reality
as being ugly and painful.

Your heart, which is interpreting
reality as being the truth.

How you see reality,
how you interpret it...

The slightest changes in those
leads to huge changes in your heart.

There are as many truths
as there are people.

But there's only one truth for you.

Built from a myopic worldview using
information altered to protect yourself...

It's a contrived truth.

A worldview that one person can hold
in their head don't amount to much.

But people can only measure things
based on their own little yardstick.

People try to see the world using only
truths that have been handed to them.

Sunny days are cheerful.

Rainy days are depressing.

You start to assume that's the case
because others tell you so.

But fun things can also happen
on rainy days.

A change in how one small detail is
interpreted can transform everything.

The truth within each of us
is a fragile thing.

That's pretty much all that
human truth amounts to.

That's what drives us
to seek out a deeper truth.

You're simply not used to
being liked by others.

So you don't have to worry about
what others think all the time.

But... doesn't everybody hate me?

What are you, an idiot? You've just gotten
that into your head on your own!

But I really do hate myself.

People who hate themselves

can never be capable of loving
or trusting others.

I'm a sneak. And a coward.

And dishonest. And a weakling.

If you understand yourself,
you can be kinder to yourself, right?

I hate who I am.

But maybe I can learn
to like myself one day!

Maybe it's okay for me to be here!

Right... The only person I can be is me.

I'm me. I want to be myself!

I want to be here!

It's okay for me to be here!

Congratulations!

Congratulations!

Congratulations.

Congratulations.

Congratulations!

Congratulations!

Congrats, buddy!

Way to go, man!

Congratulations!

Congratulations!

Congratulations!

Congratulations!

Congratulations.

Thank you.

TO FATHER, THANK YOU

TO MOTHER, GOODBYE

AND TO ALL THE CHILDREN,

CONGRATULATIONS
